                <p class="text-light text-big">Public transport operators have to support intelligent devices spread across hundreds of locations in their network. On and off-board payment systems, safety monitoring, sensors and information displays all form part of the IT infrastructure that has to be checked and updated, often manually, resulting in inefficient use of IT resources and lack of central control.</p>

                <p class="text-light">By installing SixSq’s NuvlaEdge software on intelligent devices at stops, stations and in vehicles, operators gain control over the devices and the apps deployed there. <br></p>
                <p class="text-light">Using the Nuvla platform, the operator has reliable visibility over devices and applications. Users are alerted when a device is offline and can manage the whole lifecycle of the applications, including remote updates. Additional apps can be deployed without the need for on-site visits.<br></p>
                <p class="text-light">Transport operators gain a future-proof, scalable solution with limitless possibilities for service innovation.<br></p> 
				<p class="text-light">Thanks to the&nbsp;<a href="/platform">Nuvla</a>&nbsp;edge management platform, all team members, from management to tech experts, have an overview of the fleet of edge devices and applications via the user friendly Nuvla platform dashboard.<br></p>
