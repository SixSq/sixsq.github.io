**Mobile Fog-to-Cloud Project**

SixSq participated in the H2020 project [mF2C](https://www.mf2c-project.eu), an EU-financed project looking at many of the detailed technical problems which arise at the intersection of fog computing and cloud computing. The project kicked off on 1 January 2017 and ran until 31 December 2019. The mobile Fog to Cloud project addressed the need for an open and coordinated management of fog and cloud computing systems.

**What is Fog computing?**

Fog computing, also known as fog networking or fogging, is a decentralised computing infrastructure in which data, compute, storage and applications are distributed in the most logical, efficient place between the data source and the cloud. Fog computing extends cloud computing and services to the edge of the network, bringing the advantages and power of the cloud closer to where data is created and acted upon.

**Why is it important?**

With the number of devices exponentially growing globally, new cloud and fog models are expected to emerge, paving the way for collaborative, mobile, volatile and dynamic compute, storage and network infrastructures. When put together, cloud and fog computing create a new stack of resources, which we refer to as Fog-to-Cloud (F2C), creating the need for a new, open and coordinated management ecosystem.

**How was the project funded?**

SixSq’s participation was supported by the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation [SERI](https://www.sbfi.admin.ch/sbfi/en/home.html) under contract number 16.0202. The remaining partners were financed by the [EU HORIZON 2020 Research and Innovation](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/what-horizon-2020) programme under grant agreement 730929.
	

**Project Focus**

* design an open, secure, decentralised, multi-stakeholder management framework
* privacy and security
* data storage techniques
* brokerage solutions
* SLA policies
* resource orchestration methods


**SixSq's role in the project:** 

Within the project, SixSq brought its experience in building cloud systems and early work in IoT and [edge computing](/blog/discover/2019/11/08/what-is-edge-computing) to the overall architecture. Furthermore, SixSq shared its vision in building highly valuable products and services, such as the open source [Nuvla](/platform) service and the [NuvlaEdge](/nuvlaedge) product range.  As a professional agile practitioner, SixSq contributed its industrial software development practices to ensure that mF2C results were of the highest possible quality. SixSq integrated mF2C results into its commercial products and services.
