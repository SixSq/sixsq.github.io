**Stimulating the Uptake of Commericial Digital Services by European Research Community**

The Open Clouds for Research Environments project (OCRE), aims to accelerate cloud adoption in the European research community, by bringing together cloud providers, Earth Observation (EO) organisations and the research and education community, through ready-to-use service agreements and €9.5 million in adoption funding.

Cloud-based services offer the European research community a wealth of powerful tools, but for many researchers, these are currently out of reach, with suitable services difficult to find and select.

OCRE, which launched in January 2019, will address this by running a pan-European tender and establishing framework agreements with cloud service providers that meet the specific requirements of the research community, saving institutions the time-consuming and complex process of doing this themselves.


**SixSq's role in the project:** 

SixSq’s role in OCRE is to make use of [Nuvla](/platform)’s capabilities to build the OCRE Business Platform, which will provide a voucher management system for researchers and research institutes who are looking for Cloud and Earth Observation suppliers. SixSq will also further improve and integrate its resource monitoring and accounting functionalities into the OCRE Business Platform, giving users an overall view of their resource usage.
