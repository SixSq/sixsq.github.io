Security and data protection issues are a significant barrier to wider use of cloud platforms.  PaaSword focused on reducing those barriers by providing trusted, secure storage on cloud services.  It was used for
encryption, advanced policy-based placement and context-aware access
control to realize secure, trusted cloud storage. 

SixSq used SlipStream as a "Platform as a Service" to demonstrate
how the project's storage components could be deployed easily as part of
a larger, web-based application.  On one hand, SlipStream was a use
case for the project, but SixSq also enhanced SlipStream with
features to facilitate the implementation and use of PaaSword storage
components. 


**Funding** PaaSword was funded through the European Commission's H2020
  programme under grant agreement 644814. SixSq was supported by the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation **[SERI][seri]** under contract number 15.0047.

**Duration:** 36 Months (ended December 2017) 

**Partners:** 10 lead by [CAS][cas]

**Goal for SixSq:** Main contribution was bringing a use case for
  deployment of applications needing secure storage to the cloud.
  Integration of project software into SlipStream *Platform as a
  Service* feature set. SlipStream was the forerunner to [Nuvla](https://nuvla.io/).
