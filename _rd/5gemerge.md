The 5G-EMERGE project aims to develop solutions that leverage 5G technology and satellite broadcasting to put Europe at the vanguard of media delivery technology. The project is part of the [European Space Agency](https://www.esa.int/) (ESA) programme of [Advanced Research in Telecommunications Systems](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Telecommunications_Integrated_Applications/ARTES/About_ARTES) (ARTES) and will be led by the [European Broadcasting Union](https://www.ebu.ch/home) (EBU).

The 5G-EMERGE project plans to develop an integrated satellite and terrestrial system based on open standards to enable high-quality content distribution services over multi-layer IP infra-structures. Telecommunications satellites will efficiently deliver high-demand content, including streaming of live events, as close as possible to the end user – to the ‘edge’. The project includes demonstrations in 5G base stations, users’ homes and vehicles.


**SixSq's role in the project** 

SixSq’s contribution includes leading the demonstration work package and providing the edge-to-cloud software infrastructure based on its Nuvla B2B SaaS platform and marketplace of containerised applications, as well as its open source NuvlaEdge software.


**5G-EMERGE Consortium** 

A consortium of 20 companies from six European countries will collaborate on developing the distributed edge technology and service-delivery features.
