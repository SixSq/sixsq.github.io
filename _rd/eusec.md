**Investigating effective and efficient approaches to trust, assurance and compliance in the ICT market**

The [EU-SEC](https://www.sec-cert.eu/) project studied ways to improve approaches to trust, assurance and compliance in the ICT market. To achieve its goal, EU-SEC created a framework under which existing certification and assurance approaches in the ICT market could co-exist.

The multinational and multidisciplinary consortium worked to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of existing approaches for assurance and compliance in the ICT market. The three core ideas behind the EU-SEC project were that an effective and efficient approach to trust, assurance and compliance has to:

- Balance the need of nations and business sectors to develop their specific certification schemas, bearing in mind the need to reduce compliance costs

- Avoid humans, namely auditors, doing activities that could be performed by machines (e.g. data collection)

- Ensure that accurate and reliable evidence/information is provided to the relevant people, in a timely fashion, leveraging automatic means as much as possible.


The project's main outcomes were:

- [Multi-Party Recognition Framework](https://www.sec-cert.eu/eu-sec/Multi-Party_Recognition_Framework)

- [Continuous Auditing Certification](https://www.sec-cert.eu/eu-sec/Continuous_Auditing_Certification)

- [Privacy Code of Conduct](https://www.sec-cert.eu/eu-sec/pcoc)
