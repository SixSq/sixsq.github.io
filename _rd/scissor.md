With a holistic approach, [SCISSOR][web] designed a new generation
SCADA security monitoring framework to allow for connected, yet
secure, industrial control systems.  The framework contains four
primary components: monitoring, control, analysis/decision, and a
human-machine interface.  Cloud technologies touch all of these
components, giving the system an unprecedented level of flexibility,
computing power and responsiveness.

SixSq brought its [NuvlaEdge](/platform) concept and technology to the project.  Embedding a cloud computing platform directly into the system allowed tailored, local analysis of monitoring information.

Use of the NuvlaEdge software also provided remote control of the computing platform.  Through the project, SixSq further enhanced the capabilities of the NuvlaEdge while improving resilience of the software for challenging real-world SCADA deployments.

**Funding** SCISSOR is funded through the European Commission's H2020
  programme under grant agreement 644425. SixSq is supported by the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation **[SERI][seri]** under contract number 15.0022.

**Duration:** 36 Months (ended 31/12/2017) 

**Partners:** 9 lead by [Assystem][assystem] 

**Goal for SixSq:** Bringing NuvlaEdge as platform for embedded cloud.
  Nuvla and concepts for general integration and remote control
  of NuvlaEdges. Nuvla was the forerunner to [Nuvla.io](https://nuvla.io/).
