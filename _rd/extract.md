Data has become one of our key resources, driving digital transformation in various fields. Even though the specialised data-mining processes are constantly being improved to provide more accurate analyses, mining data with “extreme” characteristics (real-time, huge quantity, security, etc.) is a challenge still to be faced.

Here’s what the EXTRACT Consortium aims to develop: through an efficient and secure platform, EXTRACT will integrate cutting-edge computing technologies combined with an AI framework, to create data-mining workflows able to generate high-quality knowledge.

EXTRACT will rely on two promising real-life use cases to validate its work:
-	A Personalized Evacuation Route service integrating data from European positioning systems, 5G localization signals and smart city IoT sensors to handle crisis management in Venice, in case of flooding.
-	Transient Astrophysics with an array pathfinder, in particular the real-time assessment of solar activity, processing data from 2000 radio-telescopes.

**Duration**

1 January 2023 to 31 December 2025.

**EXTRACT Consortium** 

10 companies and research institutes will work together on the development and implementation of these extreme data-mining workflows.
