The amount and capabilities of connected edge devices are growing, and with them the amount of data exchanged. This growth increases the need for cloud services at the edge (e.g. edge services). Implementing these edge services makes it more challenging for cloud computing architectures at the edge, especially in terms of reliability, security, and AI transparency. 

ACES aims to develop an intelligent edge-to-cloud framework, capable of managing itself in terms of workload placement, service and resource management, as well as data and policy management, thanks to AI modules.

This framework will be tested by three use cases related to the Greek energy grid, which will demonstrate how the framework can increase efficiency and reduce impact on the environment.  The use cases will demand a system which can support highly decentralised computing, deliver the ability to take autonomous decisions, and also reduce the cost of edge-to--cloud management.
