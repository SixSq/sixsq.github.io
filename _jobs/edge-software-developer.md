The edge software developer will join the dev team and contribute to the NuvlaEdge software solution. Able to run on any ARM or x86 hardware architectures, the NuvlaEdge software turns any edge device into a smart and connected device, managed by the Nuvla.io service. Using the latest Docker and container orchestration engines (e.g. Docker Swarm and Kubernetes), this highly available software is at the core of SixSq quest to disrupt the IT industry.

### Description

SixSq is building the most advanced edge-to-cloud B2B SaaS platform: Nuvla.io.  With the recent acquisition of SixSq by Ekinops, we are fast growing. We are looking for software developers, wanting to join a multi-cultural and international team.  As a software developer you will contribute to the overall objective of the company, which is to disrupt the IT industry with an open, agile, simple and efficient platform. The platform also includes a marketplace of business applications targeting the far edge in a range of sectors such as retail, manufacturing, transport, telecoms and energy.  In time, since we sell as a team, you will also be asked to support sales efforts via creative demonstrations and technical discussions with customers and prospects.

To communicate with Nuvla.io, edge devices run the NuvlaEdge software.  Packaged as micro-services (e.g. Docker, DockerSwarm or Kubernetes), NuvlaEdge provides the local environment that allows Nuvla.io to manage fleets of edge devices, as well as the life-cycle of business apps running at the edge.

The core team is based in Geneva, in beautiful Switzerland. Remote working is possible, however you must be living in or around Switzerland, with the ability to come to Geneva from time to time. As the company operates using mature agile methodologies, experience or interest in agile development is required, since this is how we think and do things.

Expect to be given time and space to learn before jumping right in developing production code for NuvlaEdge. As an agile team, we expect each developer to be able to contribute to feature definition, architecture, design, implementation, testing and operations support.  Also, expect to be presenting sharing your work to your pears, NuvleEdge Tech Lead, Scrum Master and Product Owner for feedback and guidance.

Since we continue to operate as a scale-up, with the backing of a publicly listed company, you will have the opportunity to thrive in our fast moving, and exciting work environment.
