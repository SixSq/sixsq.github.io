### Description

SixSq is building the most advanced edge-to-cloud B2B SaaS platform: Nuvla.io.  Following the recent acquisition of SixSq by Ekinops, we are growing quickly. 

The Marketing and Communications Manager will provide planning, content creation, messaging development, and campaign execution, while coordinating the necessary resources to ensure the SixSq marketing messages are effectively delivered in a timely and consistent manner to its internal and external audiences (e.g. prospects, clients, partners).
 
The primary focus of the role will be on developing the marketing and communications tools and programs that position the companyâ€™s products, anticipate customer needs, objections, and requests. The company communicates in the English language in a primarily direct sales B2B environment. The role will require constant interactions with the SixSq management and sales teams.

The core team is based in Geneva, in beautiful Switzerland. While remote working is possible from time to time, the successful candidate is expected to be located in the Geneva region. As the company operates using mature agile methodologies, experience or interest in an agile way of working is required, since this is how we think and do things.

Expect to be given time and space to learn about our products and services portfolio.  While SixSq operates as a start-up, we belong to Ekinops and therefore regular interactions will take place with the Ekinops marketing and communications team in Paris.  This will ensure our marketing and communications strategy and collateral is in sync with Ekinops's telecommunication and service provider market.
