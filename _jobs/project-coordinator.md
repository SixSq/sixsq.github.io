### Description

SixSq is building the most advanced edge-to-cloud B2B SaaS platform: Nuvla.io.  Following the recent acquisition of SixSq by Ekinops, we are growing quickly. We are looking for a project coordinator who wants to join a multi-cultural and international team.  As a project coordinator you will ensure that all projects (short PoCs, but also longer European research projects) are progressing well. You therefore will be interacting internally with several team members, including management, sales and technical, as well as with customers and partners.  Together, these projects will contribute to the company's growth objectives.

Your role will also include assisting our GDPR compliance work, ensuring our processes are up-to-date and complete.

The core team is based in Geneva, in beautiful Switzerland. While remote working is possible (maximum 2 hours difference from CET/CEST), a regular presence in Geneva is expected. As the company operates using mature agile methodologies, experience or interest in an agile way of working is required, since this is how we think and do things.

Expect to be given time and space to learn about our processes and current projects before jumping right into your coordination role. As project coordinator, we also expect you to be able to write progress reports, pulling inputs from different team members, including task progress, financial reports, detected issues, etc.

Since we continue to operate as a scale-up, with the backing of a publicly listed company, you will have the opportunity to thrive in our fast moving, and exciting work environment.
