Experience improved IoT device and data security. Once powered-up, each NuvlaEdge-powered device initiates a secured connection to the Nuvla platform.  Each device is unique and assigned to a specific user organisation. This means that any device can be controlled remotely and isolated (quarantined), upgraded or downgraded should any problems arise.
