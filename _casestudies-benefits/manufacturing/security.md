Improved IoT device and data security. Once powered-up, NuvlaEdge initiates a secured connection to Nuvla.  Each NuvlaEdge is unique and assigned to a specific user organisation. This means that any device can be controlled remotely and isolated (quarantined), upgraded or downgraded should any problems arise.
