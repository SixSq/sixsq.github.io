SixSq will be working alongside [Nottingham Scientific Ltd](https://gmvnsl.com/) (NSL) and the [University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/) on an exciting new project set to improve the exploitation and application of big data collected by global navigation systems.

Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) refers to the constellations of satellites (such as the US GPS and the European Galileo system) which provide signals from space that transmit positioning and timing data to GNSS receivers on the ground, at sea and in the air. The GNSS receivers then use this data to determine their location.

NSL is one of Europe’s leading GNSS companies and pioneers of GNSS satellite navigation technologies within critical markets such as those that directly affect safety of citizens, national strategy, and business process.

The GNSS Big Data project, which will last 18 months, will create a highly innovative and disruptive solution to provide the GNSS developer community and public authorities with new tools to gather new insights from GNSS data. The project is part of a programme of, and funded by, the European Space Agency.

Producing up to 13 TB of data daily, the new “Big Data” approach will enable expert users to deploy their own custom algorithms to process GNSS data at a new level of detail. This will open the door to new applications ranging from improved precision, to cyber defence and detection.

The novel solution includes the very latest in IT technology, including [edge](/blog/discover/2019/11/08/what-is-edge-computing) and cloud computing, providing a robust and affordable solution for wide deployment.

SixSq, under the stewardship of NSL, and in collaboration with field experts Nottingham University, is responsible for the IT aspects. SixSq’s new NuvlaScience solution forms the foundation of the IT platform, bringing together years of experience in big data science and building on recent smart city successes.
