The [Open Clouds for Research Environments project](https://www.ocre-project.eu/) (OCRE) aims to accelerate cloud adoption in the European research community, by bringing together cloud providers, Earth Observation (EO) organisations and the research and education community, through ready-to-use service agreements and €9.5 million in adoption funding. The project started on 1 January 2019 and will run for three years. To accelerate this adoption, the OCRE project will develop and operate a management platform.

SixSq will adapt its [Nuvla](/platform) open source software to deliver the required management functionality and interface it with existing European research infrastructures. The work will build upon previous community support and research activities, leveraging European investment into cloud and open source software. The result will form the OCRE Business Platform, which will provide a voucher management system for researchers and research institutes who are looking for Cloud and Earth Observation suppliers. Using the platform, users will have an overall view of their resource usage integrate including resource monitoring and accounting functionalities across a range of clouds.

The OCRE consortium combines the expertise of four partners [GEANT](https://geant.org/), [CERN](), [RHEA Group](https://www.rheagroup.com/) and[ Trust IT Services](https://www.trust-itservices.com/) to enable access to and drive the usage of commercial digital services by the European research community. SixSq is a sub-contractor to the RHEA Group and technology partner to the project.
