**SixSq’s [Nuvla](https://nuvla.io/) ecosystem facilitates the deployment, management and update of the Manufacturing Data Platform “Cybus Connectware”**

SixSq and [Cybus](https://www.cybus.io/en/) today announced a partnership to make [Cybus Connectware](https://www.cybus.io/en/product/cybus-connectware/) conveniently available via the [Nuvla Marketplace](/marketplace). This collaboration significantly simplifies the purchase, deployment and management of Cybus’ leading manufacturing data platform and realisation of intelligent manufacturing monitoring.

Manufacturing companies need to monitor and understand the state of their shop floor and array of machines to improve key performance indicators, such as their overall equipment effectiveness, reduce maintenance effort and increase production quality. With the software solution Cybus Connectware, factories establish full shop floor transparency in only a few weeks. The real-time production data is then directly distributed to built-in monitoring features for powerful and intuitive analysis tools, alerting and dashboarding.

With Cybus Connectware available in the Nuvla Marketplace, companies can now deploy, manage and update their Manufacturing Data Platform agents remotely and securely. The purchasing and deployment process is fast, simple and robust, with the app deployed at scale in a few clicks via the Nuvla dashboard.

_“From a technical perspective, Nuvla allows us to streamline and automate the distribution of our Connectware agent aligned with the needs of factories for quick and compatible digitisation setups. This is an important accelerator for digital transformation in the manufacturing industry.”_ says [Jonas Schramm](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonas-schramm-b8025315b/), Head of Product at Cybus.

_“We are delighted to be working with Cybus. The combination of Cybus Connectware and Nuvla delivers a simple, secure, powerful and scalable solution to the manufacturing sector. Customers gain a future proof way to scale their edge operations and benefit from great ROI.”_ said [Marc-Elian Bégin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mebster/), SixSq CEO and Co-founder.

The service is available via a pay-as-you-go subscription. You will find Cybus’ Manufacturing Data Platform on the [Nuvla Marketplace](https://nuvla.io/ui/sign-in?redirect=apps/cybus).
