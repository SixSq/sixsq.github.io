SixSq is proud to be part of 3 new [Horizon Europe](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe_en?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_ADIcfTzwAg6q5_ZHWG0WnKO7fayNUFoOvu3MwVWQpcmCYv8T1gAZUyyJdcrLizxfHPxbq) projects, thanks to funding from the Swiss government agency [SEFRI](https://www.sbfi.admin.ch/sbfi/en/home.html), which supports Swiss participation in the EU Framework Programme. The projects will give the team the opportunity of working with the very best innovators in Europe to keep SixSq software and services at the cutting edge of technology. All of the 3-year projects focus on computer architecture in the edge-to-cloud space and will be tested via concrete use cases across a wide range of sectors. 


- [ICOS](https://sixsq.com/rd/icos.html?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_ADIcfTzwAg6q5_ZHWG0WnKO7fayNUFoOvu3MwVWQpcmCYv8T1gAZUyyJdcrLizxfHPxbq) is designing an AI-powered continuum which is open, secure, adaptable and technology-agnostic. The solution will be tested via [4 use cases](https://www.icos-project.eu/use-cases) in the fields of agriculture, multimedia systems, railway infrastructure monitoring and energy mangement.

- [EXTRACT](https://sixsq.com/rd/extract.html) aims to develop a data-mining platform for extreme data, leveraging the knowledge of 10 Consortium partners around two interesting use cases: personalised evacuation routing in case of emergency and transforming huge volumes of raw data from radio-telescopes into high quality reusable datasets for use in 15 different scientific domains. 


- The [ACES](https://sixsq.com/rd/aces.html) edge-to-cloud framework will be able of managing itself in terms of workload placement, service and resource management, as well as data and policy management, thanks to AI capabilities.

Participaton in these projects confirms SixSq's commitment to delivering the most innovative solutions to its customers.
