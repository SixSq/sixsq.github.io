SixSq is proud to be part of 3 new [Horizon Europe](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe_en?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_ADIcfTzwAg6q5_ZHWG0WnKO7fayNUFoOvu3MwVWQpcmCYv8T1gAZUyyJdcrLizxfHPxbq) projects which will give the team the opportunity of working with the very best innovators in Europe to keep SixSq software and services at the cutting edge of technology. All of the 3-year projects focus on computer architecture in the edge-to-cloud space and will be tested via concrete use cases, including monitoring of railway infrastructure, energy management systems and personalised evacuation routing in case of emergency. 



- [ICOS](https://sixsq.com/rd/icos.html?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_ADIcfTzwAg6q5_ZHWG0WnKO7fayNUFoOvu3MwVWQpcmCYv8T1gAZUyyJdcrLizxfHPxbq) is designing an AI-powered continuum which is open, secure, adaptable and technology-agnostic. The solution will be tested via [4 use cases](https://www.icos-project.eu/use-cases).

- [EXTRACT](https://sixsq.com/rd/extract.html) aims to develop a data-mining platform for extreme data, leveraging the knowledge of 10 Consortium partners around two interesting use cases. 

- The [ACES](https://sixsq.com/rd/aces.html) edge-to-cloud framework will be able of managing itself in terms of workload placement, service and resource management, as well as data and policy management, thanks to AI capabilities.

Participaton in these projects confirms SixSq's commitment to delivering the most innovative solutions to its customers.
