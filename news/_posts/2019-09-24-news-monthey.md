The city of Monthey wants to live up to its European Energy Award and has its sights set on the European Energy Award® GOLD. It therefore has stiff targets with regards to **sustainable development**, which are made harder to achieve because of significant population growth in the region. This makes the success of their projects related to energy efficiency, mobility issues and traffic management even more critical. One of its key projects is **Smart Monthey** which has put in place an adaptive lighting system. With approximately 2,050 luminaires installed on the territory of Monthey, innovative solutions like this are fundamental to the achievement of targets for energy savings and cost reduction.

**The Background**

Between 2015 and 2017, mercury vapour luminaires in Monthey were replaced by LEDs and equipped with a remote management system based on [Owlet](https://www.schreder.com/en/product-technical-control-system/owlet-iot), a solution for optimising energy consumption developed by [Schréder Swiss SA](https://ch.schreder.com/fr). Smart lighting is made possible through the use of sensors detecting presence of traffic on the roads. This provides the right light at the right time. The luminaires can be further leveraged by the installation of sensors to carry out tasks such as counting vehicles and measuring noise pollution, etc. Anonymised data derived from these sensors can be used to inform the city’s decision making on mobility and other issues.

**The Smart Solution**

Within the framework of the [CityZen](https://www.cityzen.ch/) association, partners Schréder Swiss and SixSq were chosen to deploy the VolumLight® solution for Smart Monthey. VolumLight® allows the control of lighting according to the volume of traffic in real time. In addition to providing optimal lighting and safety conditions, VolumLight produces valuable traffic data. This is made possible by SixSq’s [Nuvla](/casestudies/overview) solution, an open-source [edge computing](/blog/discover/2019/11/08/what-is-edge-computing) platform for scalable smart city solutions.

Pre-processed and anonymised on the edge, the data is analysed, then represented and communicated to the various stakeholders (decision makers, associations, citizens …) via a series of interactive maps and dashboards within ArcGIS Online, the geospatial platform developed by [Esri](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home).

Energy savings of **over 30%** are expected by the end of the project.
