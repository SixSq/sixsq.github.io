SixSq is proud to announce the introduction of the **Switch Group** feature, in response to user requests to improve the management at scale of apps, edge devices and container orchestration engine resources.

As users scale their deployments and the number of edge to cloud resources, they need to maintain a crystal clear understanding of the state of each resource, and their security context.

As a result, the SixSq team has replaced and improved the previous **Act As** group feature with a more comprehensive and unified **Switch Group** feature.

**New feature gives improved security**

By deploying the new **Switch Group** feature, users only see the resources belonging to that group, not the resources from their personal account or from other groups they are part of. For example, when managing different customers, a user simply has to switch to a group and only resources related to that group will be shown.

Furthermore, this new feature also simplifies and improves security. A user can no longer create a VPN credential after switching to a group. Creating a VPN credential is only available via a personal account. This credential then gives access to all NuvlaEdge powered devices belonging to the personal account, as well as those belonging to groups the user is part of.

**Whatâ€™s coming next?**

We hope that this new feature will fulfil the many requests we received to improve management, at scale, of edge to cloud resources.

For the moment, creating groups requires a support request, which you can submit anytime, for free, via email or via the in-app support widget. In the near future, you will be able to create your own groups and invite colleagues to join them.

If you need any help or have further questions, do not hesitate to get in touch, either by email or via the in-app widget on our website or in Nuvla.
