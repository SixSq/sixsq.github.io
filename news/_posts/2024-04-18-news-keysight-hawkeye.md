#### SixSq’s Nuvla.io ecosystem facilitates the deployment, management, and update of Keysight’s Hawkeye Active Monitoring Solution 


**Geneva, April 18 2024**, SixSq, an Ekinops Company, and [Keysight Technologies](https://www.keysight.com/us/en/home.html) today announced a partnership to deliver [Keysight Hawkeye Active Network Monitoring Solution](https://www.keysight.com/us/en/products/network-visibility/hawkeye-software-suite.html) via the Nuvla.io Marketplace. This collaboration significantly simplifies the procurement, deployment, and management of Keysight’s solution.

In today's digital age, networks must operate at peak performance. If service providers wait for their network monitoring tools to detect a problem, performance issues could impact their customers and potentially damage their reputation. Telecommunications companies and enterprise businesses need tools that can simulate real-world application traffic in order to anticipate potential issues and optimize network performance.

The **Keysight Hawkeye Active Network Monitoring Solution** meets this challenge by quickly and effectively validating network performance, isolating problems, and proactively detecting issues. It does this by running scheduled verification tests on any site using wireline or wireless connections. Using a combination of hardware and software agents, Hawkeye simulates application traffic and sends key performance metrics to a central console for fast action. Measurements range from network quality to user experience, enabling network operators to improve overall uptime and detect network performance issues before they impact end users, ensuring quality of service for the enterprise. 

SixSq’s [Nuvla.io](/platform) is a proven B2B digital platform for industrialization and automation of containerized edge applications and device management.
