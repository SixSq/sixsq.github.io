In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, telecommunication companies (telcos) are encountering an unprecedented demand for faster, more secure, and remarkably efficient services. The traditional portfolio of telcos, once reliant on voice and text services, is undergoing a perceptible decline due to the prevalence of internet-based communication platforms and the predominant use of smartphones. This shift is intensified by the growing influence of hyperscale technology giants that offer a range of services including cloud computing, data storage, and digital platforms. 

These hyperscalers have effectively disrupted the market by capitalizing on their massive infrastructure, data handling capabilities, and innovative solutions. As a result, telcos are now being pushed to reimagine their business models, seeking ways to harness their infrastructure strengths and explore new domains and value-added digital offerings. The challenge lies in striking a balance between their traditional strengths and adapting to the evolving technological landscape dominated by hyperscalers, all while ensuring they remain relevant and competitive in an increasingly interconnected world.

### Edge computing delivers innovative solutions 

The emergence of **[edge computing](/blog/discover/2019/11/08/what-is-edge-computing)** provides telcos with a unique opportunity to revolutionize their offering, presenting innovative solutions that suit the diverse needs of multiple industries. Through the integration of edge computing, telcos can effectively address a multitude of challenges for both wired and mobile networks. 
  
Within the sphere of the telco industry, service providers are in constant pursuit of enhancing the quality and security of their services. Through the power of edge computing, telcos can introduce cutting-edge monitoring solutions that offer real-time insights into network performance. This, in turn, empowers proactive maintenance and rapid issue resolution. Furthermore, edge-based cybersecurity mechanisms can swiftly identify and mitigate potential security threats, thereby ensuring the integrity of data and fostering user trust. Moreover, the minimized latency achieved through edge computing significantly optimizes service delivery, resulting in elevated user experiences. 

### A customer-centric approach

The pursuit of innovation, however, shouldn't only focus on understanding the needs of telcos themselves; it's equally important to understand the aspirations of telco customers and how edge computing can support them and their businesses. Edge computing empowers telcos to offer solutions that appeal to a wide range of sectors, including: 

- Enhancing worker safety in industrial settings through AI-driven safety monitoring.  
- Improving product tracking and inventory management. 
- Using edge-based analytics to facilitate accurate supply chain management.  
- Providing anonymized video services with privacy while still delivering insights for business operations.  
- Integrating predictive analytics to contribute to decision-making processes.  
- Delivering robust cybersecurity measures embedded in edge solutions to safeguard data security across all business operations. 

Another common challenge involves identifying efficient solutions for managing and scaling containerized applications. Edge computing emerges as a powerful solution to this challenge, streamlining the complexity associated with handling these applications while supporting operational and resource demands. 

Other customers are on the lookout for a more all-rounded ecosystem that allows them to manage all applications needed to pursue a complete and tailored solution to solve their problems. The idea centers around integrating a comprehensive [marketplace](/marketplace)  with containerized app management. The answer to this need comes in the form of [Nuvla.io](/platform), an integrated platform from SixSq that facilitates seamless access to a diverse range of applications, coupled with streamlined management and scalability options. 
  
In essence, edge computing can drive a transformation within the telco industry, enabling providers to introduce innovative solutions that cater to a wide spectrum of requirements spanning wired and mobile networks. Through the utilization of SixSq's Nuvla.io ecosystem, telcos can push their services to new heights, enhancing performance, security, and efficiency. From **cutting-edge monitoring** and **cybersecurity** to AI-driven **video analysis**, the possibilities are endless. As the telco landscape continues to evolve, embracing edge computing is no longer an option â€” it's a necessity for staying ahead in the digital age.
