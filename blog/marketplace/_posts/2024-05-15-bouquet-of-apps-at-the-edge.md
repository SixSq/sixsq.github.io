Why settle for something less than exquisite when you’re running [artificial intelligence (AI) at the edge](/blog/discover/2024/03/22/running-ai-at-the-edge.html)? We think you deserve a beautiful bouquet of hand-picked machine-learning (ML) apps.  
 
### Everything’s coming up roses 
 
If a single vendor says they can provide a complete scope of ML apps, be very sceptical. Both AI in general and the ML sector specifically are moving at an incredible pace – beautiful apps are appearing every day but never just in one place.  
 
### Fastening it all together 
  
What’s required is a way to bring it all together. At SixSq, we believe an ecosystem is the best way to do this, presenting you with a complete and future-proof solution. 
 
### Arranging everything attractively 
 
Our edge-to-cloud management platform, [Nuvla.io](/platform) is designed to support app bouquets. You are free to arrange your selection in an attractive bundle, picking ML apps from our [Nuvla.io Marketplace](/marketplace) and from third party vendors, as well as using your own.  
 
### Putting a smile on your face 
 
And we’ve thought of all those little details in advance. It’s our way of making sure your IT team can minimise ML ops costs while maintaining clear [T&Cs](https://sixsq.com/legal/legal-general-terms-and-conditions-v2.html), SLAs, support services, pricing and more.
