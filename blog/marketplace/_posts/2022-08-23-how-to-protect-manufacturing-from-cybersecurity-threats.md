Thanks to guest author [Inna Ushakova](https://www.linkedin.com/in/innaushakova/) for sharing her valuable insights into the state of cyber security in the manufacturing industry. 

### Manufacturing under threat 

Now more than ever, cybersecurity is extremely relevant for the manufacturing industry. [IBM’s X-Force Threat Intelligence Index 2022](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/ADLMYLAZ) report found that manufacturing is the most attacked industry as of 2021, receiving the brunt of 23.2% of the attacks and reaching a global average of **$4.24M in data breach costs**.

The manufacturing industry lacks cybersecurity maturity, a fact that criminals exploit relentlessly. This is evidenced by the high-stakes burdens on supply chains wreaking havoc on the manufacturing industry, which is still recovering from the losses of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Instrumental to the wellbeing and healthy performance of any manufacturing company, operational technology (OT) supports core-business operations and its safety is essential to ensure sustainable growth and effective means of innovation. For that to happen, **cybersecurity needs to be a key, foundational element of any company’s core strategy**. High, rigorous security standards and protocols in data, software, and infrastructure coupled with AI-powered solutions allows for process agility and transparency. 

Below,  we detail some of the most high-profile cybersecurity attacks of recent years to illustrate how severe and crucial it is for manufacturing companies to take their environment security seriously.

### Manufacturing prominent cybersecurity attacks

The manufacturing industry is victim to ransomware, server access, BEC  and data theft, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, credential harvesting, and more. Next, let’s see some of these attacks in action:

1. **Visser Precision**, a space and defense manufacturer, experienced an attack involving DoppelPaymer ransomware, which encrypted and exfiltrated data. Researchers discovered sensitive company documents, including non-disclosure agreements with Tesla, SpaceX, and General Dynamics, that had been published on a hacker's website created to publicize the list of files stolen in the attack. In addition to the non-disclosure agreements, the theft also included a Lockheed Martin schematic for a missile antenna.

2. As the result of a devastating cyberattack involving the LockerGoga ransomware, **Norsk Hydro**, a multinational aluminum manufacturer with operations in 40 countries, closed many of its plants and was forced to move others offline. 
	
	The attack compromised the firm's IT systems across multiple business functions, including the company's smelting plants in Norway, Qatar, and Brazil. The total cost is estimated at $75 million. 
	
3. **Mondelez**, a multinational food and beverage company, succumbed to an attack that leveraged the encrypting malware NotPetya. 
	The attack permanently damaged 1,700 servers and 24,000 laptops. It also impacted production facilities around the globe. Mondelez says that the attack included the theft of thousands of user credentials and impacted the company's ability to complete customer orders. 
	
	Mondelez sued its insurance company, Zurich, due to the insurer's decision not to pay an insurance claim. The insurer claimed the use of NotPetya was an act of war not covered under the policy. According to statements made to WIRED magazine, the White House estimated that NotPetya generated $10 billion in damages.


Cybersecurity experts assert that cyber criminals are using more ruthless methods to achieve their objectives and the proficiency of attacks is expected to advance as they continue to develop new methods for cyber attacks. For all industries with OT networks ransomware again led the charge for attack types, accounting for 36% of all attacks and echoing the overall attack trend across all industries. While the IT networks were compromised in the vast majority of these attacks, the impact carried over to victims’ operational technology in many of these instances.

For instance, the [Mozi botnet](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/ADLMYLAZ) continues to threaten Internet of Things (IoT) and OT assets in the form of data exfiltration, command or payload execution, or DDoS attacks. Mozi is a peer-to-peer (P2P) botnet that uses a BitTorrent-like network to infect IoT devices.

Mozi typically works by abusing weak Telnet passwords and exploiting vulnerabilities to target networking devices, IoT, and video recorders, among other internet-connected products. Post-infection, it is capable of maintaining persistence on network gateways, which can be particularly effective to penetrate initial access points for lateral movement to high-value networks, including OT and ICS networks. 

In addition, by infecting routers, threat actors behind Mozi can position themselves to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks that lead to ransomware deployment, including attacks on OT networks. In addition to Mozi’s access and lateral movement capabilities, a large Mozi botnet that infects a large number of security cameras or similar IoT devices in an organization can hinder an organization’s ability to effectively conduct physical security operations. 

Looking at the variety of attacks and the latest cyber criminal developments, the manufacturing industry remains a high-interest target for cybercriminals looking to deploy well-crafted attacks. Cyber attacks are relatively easy for criminals to conduct and are hard to protect against using traditional security technologies. 

## How can an AI-powered solution advance your Edge/IoT cyber security?

Cyber security is more important than ever before, as the attack surface area has increased due to the next wave of digital transformation that is enhancing business agility and developing new customer experiences. When it comes to the security of Edge and IoT infrastructures, Artificial intelligence and deep reinforcement learning are unmatched. 

The [AI EdgeLabs platform](https://edgelabs.ai/platform/) is embedded with a proprietary network telemetry and monitoring sensor that protects every layer of an Edge and IoT architecture. The AI-powered solution delivers smart means to detect anomalies that signal the presence of threats, threat intelligence software with powerful analytics tools for robust traffic inspection, and swift incident response and remediation.

During its deployment on-premises (on the factory side), the AI EdgeLabs Sensor runs a configurable set of security checks and topology research to collect the initial context of your environment. Data collected from the sensor is analyzed by the AI EdgeLabs platform that provides a set of AI-based models that are pre-trained in the existing knowledge base of threat patterns and attack signatures.

Looking at the graph above, we can see the SCADA power system. The electrical distribution system consists of controllers, sensors, and operator-interface points. 

For real-time monitoring and controlling of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), the system uses circuit breakers and power monitors. Data is transmitted from PLCs and other devices to a computer-based SCADA node located on each sub-station. 

One or more computers can be located on different points. The AI EdgeLabs Sensor can be implemented on each computer-based SCADA node to protect the whole system, including factory machines, HMIs, sensors, and end devices from malfunctioning, data modifying, injection attacks such as SQL injection and other forms of advanced malware.

The EdgeLabs Sensor helps: 

- Generate near-time visibility of infrastructure and application performance; 
- Prevent and block threat sources in real-time;
- Integrate cloud-based and on-premises application performance monitoring; 
- Monitor SaaS applications from your users’ vantage point; 
- Monitor IaaS resources from your users’ vantage point.

The AI EdgeLabs platform equips your security teams with multilayered threat intelligence software, advanced network visibility, and automated remediation to protect every asset, device, server, or network element of your manufacturing environment.


With AI EdgeLabs available in the [Nuvla Marketplace](https://sixsq.com/marketplace), companies now have an easier way to cyber protect their edge assets. Find out more [here](https://sixsq.com/news/2022/06/13/news-aiedgelabs.html).
