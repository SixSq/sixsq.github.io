Nuvla.io is cloud- and container-native. And since Docker and Kubernetes are supported by virtually all public and private clouds, this means you can use the Nuvla.io platform with your favourite cloud. This protects you from vendor lock-in, providing unprecedented flexibility in your choice of cloud solutions as well as edge hardware.
