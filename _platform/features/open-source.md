The Nuvla platform is built leveraging open-source software and open standards. All of our dependencies are Apache 2.0-compatible. This means that we leverage not only the latest innovations from the thriving open-source communities, but also their maturity. From there, you are able to build your own edge-to-cloud journey, knowing that there's no lock-in. Meanwhile, <a href="nuvlaedge">NuvlaEdge</a> is 100% open source.
