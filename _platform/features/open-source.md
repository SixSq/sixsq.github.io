Nuvla is built leveraging open source software and open standards. All of our dependencies are Apache 2.0 compatible. This means that we leverage the latest innovations from the thriving open source communities, but also their maturity. From there, you are able to build your own edge-to-cloud journey, knowing that there is no lock-in. Meanwhile, <a href="nuvlaedge">NuvlaEdge</a> 100% is open source.
