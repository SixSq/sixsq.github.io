Nuvla.io is container-native. Simply capture your app in the platform, including the endpoint of a Docker Registry, with credentials. The Nuvla.io platform will be able to deploy your app at scale. You can also take advantage of 1000s of existing Docker images, such as load balancers, databases, AI tools and more. All this from the comfort of a <em>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</em> offering and the [marketplace](/marketplace).
