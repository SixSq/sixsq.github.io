Via <a href="nuvlaedge">NuvlaEdge</a> software, the Nuvla platform can manage edge devices, servers and virtual machines based on both ARM and x86 [hardware](/nuvlaedge#hardware). This means you can choose the right hardware for the right application, and yet use the same management platform to simplify operations.
