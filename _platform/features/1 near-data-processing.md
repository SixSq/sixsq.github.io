Bring the processing to the data. Instead of moving tons of data to the cloud, do the sensible thing and take advantage of edge computing. This means you process your data in near real-time, reduce your reliance on the networks, reduce runaway cloud costs, improve data sovereignty, avoid privacy intrusion, improve autonomy and reduce carbon emissions.
