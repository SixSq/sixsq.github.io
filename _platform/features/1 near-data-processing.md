Instead of moving tons of data to the cloud, take advantage of edge computing by bringing the processing to the data. This means you process your data in near-real time, reduce your reliance on the networks, reduce runaway cloud costs, improve data sovereignty, avoid privacy intrusion, improve autonomy and reduce carbon emissions.
