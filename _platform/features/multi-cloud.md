Nuvla allows you to configure any number of Container as a Service (CaaS) (e.g. Docker Swarm, Kubernetes) endpoints. This means you can mix and match public clouds, private clouds and infrastructure, as well as edge devices running the NuvlaEdge software. This enables a simple and effective, edge-to-multi-cloud solution.
