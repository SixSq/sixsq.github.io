The Nuvla.io platform not only supports Docker but also Kubernetes, the de-facto standard for the orchestration of large container clusters. Simply capture your application deployment as a Kubernetes manifest in Nuvla.io, and use the platform to deploy your apps on any Kubernetes cluster, including your own.
