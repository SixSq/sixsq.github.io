Once powered-up, the NuvlaEdge powered device initiates a secured connection to Nuvla. Once the secured registration process is done, each NuvlaEdge is unique and assigned to a specific user account or group. This means that any device can be controlled remotely and isolated (quarantined), upgraded or downgraded should any problems arise. You can also go to the next level of security by deploying AI driven cyber defence apps from our [app vendors](/marketplace#app-vendors).
