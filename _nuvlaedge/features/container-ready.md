Any application packaged as Docker containers and built for your hardware platform (e.g. ARM, x86) can be deployed on a NuvlaEdge-powered edge device. You can also manage multi-container apps using Docker Compose, Docker Swarm or Kubernetes. This means you can create highly available apps at the edge and in the cloud.
