Unlike most edge solutions, the NuvlaEdge software does not impose anything on the way you build your apps. This mean you can bring your favourite tools, language and libraries to build your edge apps. This facilitates reuse and gets you where you want to be faster. We also donâ€™t impose any Software Development Kit (SDK), ensuring no lock-in, nor unnecessary constraints.
