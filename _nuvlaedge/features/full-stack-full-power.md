Unlike most edge solutions, NuvlaEdge software does not impose anything on the way you build your apps. This means you can bring your favourite tools, language and libraries to build your edge apps. This facilitates reuse and gets you where you want to be faster. We also don’t impose any specific software development kit (SDK), ensuring no lock-in nor unnecessary constraints.
