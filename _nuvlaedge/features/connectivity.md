Certified for all common forms of IP connectivity, the NuvlaEdge-powered edge device can communicate on mobile (3G, 4G and 5G), Ethernet, Wi-Fi and even satellite. When registering a NuvlaEdge device, an optional secured VPN connection can be automatically established with the Nuvla.io platform. From there you can control your edge devices as if they were sitting on your desk, on your private network.
