NuvlaEdge is now fully open source software, and we ensure that the entire stack, including its dependencies, is Apache 2.0 compatible. This means that we leverage the latest innovations from the thriving open source communities, but also their maturity. This also means that you have full visibility on the software you run on your infrastructure, knowing that there is no lock-in.
