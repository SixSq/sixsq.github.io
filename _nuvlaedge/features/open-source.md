NuvlaEdge is now fully open-source software, and we ensure that the entire stack, including its dependencies, is Apache 2.0 compatible. This means that we leverage not only the latest innovations from the thriving open-source communities, but also their maturity. This also means that you have full visibility of the software you run on your infrastructure, knowing that there is no lock-in.
