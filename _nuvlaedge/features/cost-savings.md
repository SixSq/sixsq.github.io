By moving to containers, you can replace several physical servers with a single NuvlaEdge-powered edge device. And with the Nuvla secured remote-management platform, you can centralise your operations and save on network costs, while improving security and privacy. Why clog up your office with ugly and noisy servers when you could have a highly optimised, silent and simple-to-operate edge-to-cloud solution?
