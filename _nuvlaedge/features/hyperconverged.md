NuvlaEdge software turns any certified x86 and ARM hardware platform into a hyperconverged system, where users can “carve” as much resources as needed for a given application. This means applications can happily run alongside each other, even on small devices, with minimum impact on each other. Via the [Nuvla.io management platform](/platform), containerised applications can be dynamically deployed, monitored and updated, without needing to change the hardware.
