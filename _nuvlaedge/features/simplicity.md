Smart factory settings and zero config means it’s child’s play to set up and use. You can even ship your edge hardware with minimum configuration and let a non-expert in the field register and activate the devices running NuvlaEdge software in a simple and secure manner. Combined with [Nuvla.io](/platform) remote-control capabilities, this means you don’t need IT experts onsite anymore. And you can watch and manage your growing edge fleet from the comfort of your centralised Nuvla.io dashboard.
