Working with specialist [hardware vendors](#hardware), you can create ruggedised platforms, for extreme weather and environments. The same applies for connectivity, including 5G and satellite. Combined with our robust software, this means your devices running NuvlaEdge software have the best chance to survive their mission, even in harsh and semi-connected environments. And if a device is compromised, you can use [Nuvla.io](platform) to isolate the device, while it gets investigated.
