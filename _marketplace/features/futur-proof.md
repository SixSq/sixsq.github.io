The Nuvla marketplace takes full advantage of the Nuvla [platform](/platform), providing a complete lifecycle for apps deployed by customers on their edge and cloud infrastructures. App vendors and authors are able to provide updates regularly, which Nuvla can apply with customer consent. Furthermore, [customers](#customer-journey) can add, remove and swap apps at any time, to support their evolving business.
