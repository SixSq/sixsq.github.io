The Nuvla marketplace [pricing](/pricing) scheme is simple and transparent. The app vendor [sets the price](#vendor-journey). The usage is metered by the day and invoiced monthly. SixSq takes a fee and pays the vendor the remaining amount on payment by the customer. The metering starts only after 24 hours, giving the customer time to explore and validate the purchase.
