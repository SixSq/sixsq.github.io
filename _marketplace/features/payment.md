The Nuvla Marketplace integrates with the Stripe payment system. Supporting both credit cards and bank transfer (e.g. SEPA for Euro transactions), payment management is handled automatically. Vendors have their own payment dashboard and customers can monitor in real time their consumption and access clear billing statements.
