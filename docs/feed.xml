<p><a href="https://sixsq.com/platform">Nuvla</a> is a proven B2B SaaS digital platform and marketplace for industrialization and automation of containerized edge applications and device management. Nuvla enables the deployment of these applications on the Ekinops <a href="https://www.ekinops.com/products-services/products/oneaccess">OneAccess</a> branded customer premise equipment (CPE), as well as a large range of certified hardware platforms. The Nuvla marketplace contains a growing number of ready-made apps, provided by domain matter experts (aka app vendors). These apps can be automatically deployed in 1-click to any Nuvla-enabled edges, eliminating human error and improving quality. Furthermore, users can register their own apps, creating a private app store, mixing in commercially available apps from the marketplace.</p>

<p>The simplified Terms and Conditions (T&amp;C) and End User License Agreement (EULA) make business between app vendors, customers and end users frictionless and straightforward. They also support network service providers and system integrators in generating additional recurring revenue at the edge and in the cloud.</p>

<p><strong>SixSq’s CEO Marc-Elian Bégin</strong> said, <em>“With this major update to our T&amp;C, we are bringing to edge computing the frictionless business enablement that Amazon created when they introduced cloud computing 17 years ago.”</em></p>

<p>The key highlights of the new legal framework are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Clear terms between app vendors, the Nuvla operator (SixSq) and customers to enable frictionless business, including payments</li>
  <li>Geographical legal coverage now including Europe, North America, the Middle East and Asia Pacific</li>
  <li>Easier to read and better organized terms</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Ekinops’s CEO Didier Brédy</strong> said, <em>“Ekinops is always pushing innovation and simplicity in our industry. With this updated legal framework, we are able to offer telecom operators, as well as their enterprise &amp; SMB customers, a new and much simpler way of leveraging edge computing, building on the well-established Ekinops portfolio. This is a win-win for both Ekinops and our customers to create new revenue streams.”</em></p>

<p>The changes came into force on 11 May 2023 and users were given the opportunity to review the details before continuing to use the service.</p>

<p>The updated Terms and Conditions can be found <a href="https://sixsq.com/legal/legal-general-terms-and-conditions-v2.html">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Geneva and Los Angeles - 25 January 2023</strong> SixSq, an <a href="https://www.ekinops.com/">Ekinops</a> Company, and <a href="https://www.varnish-software.com/">Varnish Software</a>, a leader in caching, streaming and content delivery software solutions,  today announced a partnership to integrate and deliver Varnish Software’s feature-rich suite of web cache and HTTP accelerator solutions - <a href="https://www.varnish-software.com/solutions/varnish-enterprise/">Varnish Enterprise</a> - via the Nuvla platform and marketplace. This integration significantly simplifies the procurement, deployment and management of Varnish Software’s technology, enabling new capabilities and unparalleled performance for SixSq customers and their users at the edge.</p>

<p>By utilizing the <a href="https://sixsq.com/marketplace">Nuvla Marketplace</a> to deploy Varnish Software, telecom operators and CSPs in any location can now flawlessly deliver lightning-fast, high-quality web and streaming experiences while significantly lowering costs and hardware requirements across an entire ecosystem of distributed edges.</p>

<p><em>“Service providers require consistent and reliable speed and performance to deliver excellent web experiences for users, at scale,”</em> said Irene Lundin, Chief Delivery Officer at Varnish Software. <em>“Nuvla speeds up the way we can deliver Varnish Software by simplifying the deployment and maintenance process. We are now better equipped to deliver next-gen connectivity wherever it is needed, anywhere in the world.”</em></p>

<p>The new integration is part of a broader collaboration between the two companies to bridge 5G satellite communications with advanced web caching and content delivery at the edge, which includes contributions to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU)’s <a href="https://www.ebu.ch/news/2022/06/esa-and-ebu-to-build-solutions-for-emerging-satellite-enabled-5g-media-market">5G-EMERGE consortium</a>.</p>

<p><em>“Our partnership with Varnish Software perfectly demonstrates the value of app delivery using the Nuvla Marketplace,”</em> said Marc-Elian Bégin, SixSq CEO and Co-founder. <em>“Customers from any business sector can now deploy Varnish Software’s caching app at the telco edge, near edge as well as far edge, with a direct and measurable positive impact on the digital experience of users.”</em></p>

<p>Importantly, Varnish Enterprise is the only software that can provide an edge runtime environment, enabling operators to write and execute compute logic as close to the end user as possible in mere microseconds. It can be installed in front of any server that accepts requests via HTTP/HTTPS to significantly speed up response time by an impressive 300 – 1000%, and reduce backend server load by up to 99%.</p>

<p>SixSq’s Nuvla is a proven B2B digital platform for industrialization and automation of containerized edge applications and device management. The Nuvla app vendor program gives app vendors and customers tools to interact in a seamless way, including clear pricing and contractual terms. It also provides hassle-free monetization of business applications for telcos, service providers and system integrators.</p>

<p>With Varnish Enterprise available on the Nuvla Marketplace, companies can now deploy, manage and update an enterprise-grade caching solution to deliver a high-quality digital experience, remotely and securely. The purchasing and deployment process is fast, simple and robust, with the app deployed at scale in a few clicks via the Nuvla dashboard.</p>

<p>The service is available via a pay-as-you-go subscription.

But for industries to move, there needs to be real and meaningful benefits, achievable within reasonable investment and at an acceptable risk.  It would indeed therefore be great to identify the ‘killer app’ for edge computing – a single heroic app to unlock the full potential of this promising distributed computing paradigm, one that’s capable of fulfilling the level of world domination predicted by analysts. So where is it?</p>

<p>Perhaps this is the wrong question. If we stand back, the edge is not there to run a single all-encompassing, killer app, but to enable an ecosystem of applications that allows organisations to better extract value from data near its source. And this objective is neither simple nor standard, since, like us humans, every business is different, with different goals, constraints and assets. However, edge computing will not succeed if all its implementations are bespoke. The good news is that there is an existing ecosystem that exhibits a similar need for wide and wild variety, yet is based on standardised building blocks that tech companies can provide at affordable pricing, thanks to economy of scale.</p>

<p>Where is this ecosystem? I suggest looking in your pocket. The dominance of the smartphone appliance is no longer questioned today… yet what about all those apps? Your mobile device is not satisfied with a one-size-fits-all killer app, so why should your edge infrastructure be any different?</p>

<p>Apparently, even the mighty Steve Jobs didn’t initially foresee the rise of the App Store as a key part of the iPhone®’s success story, instead expecting web apps to be the next big thing. Apple® had to move quickly to meet developer demands, opening up the iPhone® ecosystem to allow these people to create native iOS apps and this, in turn, led to the creation of the App Store to monetise these apps and make them available to customers.</p>

<h3 id="the-first-marketplace-for-edge-apps">The first marketplace for edge apps</h3>

<p>For edge computing to work well, businesses need a simple and scalable way to purchase apps and immediately deploy them where their data is. But of course no-one needs integration complexity, complicated contractual negotiations and operational risk.</p>

<p>Here at SixSq we’re now on a similar path to Apple®, building the world’s first repository of edge apps, the Nuvla Marketplace, usefully informed by the experiences of the App Store, Google Play® and other digital distribution platforms.</p>

This <a href="https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe_en">Horizon Europe</a> project has the ambition of delivering a Meta-Operating System within 3 years, bridging IoT devices to the cloud through <a href="https://sixsq.com/blog/discover/2019/11/08/what-is-edge-computing.html">edge computing</a> devices.</p>

<p>ICOS, code name for ‘IoT2Cloud Operating System’, is a unique computing system supporting the interconnection of IoT, edge and cloud resources.</p>

<p>The concept of a continuum between IoT, edge and cloud aims to tackle the challenges linked to the ever-growing sector of computing and sensing devices, and to the increasing demand for data-intensive applications, especially at the edge and in the cloud.</p>

<p>By enabling this continuum, in a way which is both technology and device-agnostic, ICOS will facilitate data generation, transfer, and processing - thanks to AI.</p>

<p>ICOS System architecture, functional requirements and use cases were at the heart of the discussions during this 2-day meeting. Indeed, ICOS will address real-life challenges in various fields, with a positive impact on reliability and sustainability.</p>

<p>4 relevant <a href="https://www.icos-project.eu/use-cases">use cases</a> were brought by project partners:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Bring precision agriculture to the next step by embarking ICOS into agricultural robots, or agrobots, in the fields. Thanks to AI modules, the robots will be able to detect a disease among a plantation, calculate the real amount of fertiliser needed by each plant, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Improve railway maintenance thanks to a combination of IoT sensors and edge devices, enabling real-time monitoring of the infrastructure metrics and optimising decision-making process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enhance “in-car” user experience thanks to immersive content display linked to touristic trips, and shared media streaming.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Optimise household energy consumption thanks to an autonomous system based on continuum management.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Fruitful interactions took place during the “ICOS match” workshop between technologies and user stories. The SixSq team was glad to see that <a href="/platform">Nuvla</a>/<a href="https://sixsq.com/nuvlaedge">NuvlaEdge</a> had a lot of matches and will bring value to all of the use cases in the project by facilitating management of IoT devices and applications.</p>

<p>Now more than ever, cybersecurity is extremely relevant for the manufacturing industry. IBM’s X-Force Threat Intelligence Index 2022 report found that manufacturing is the most attacked industry as of 2021, receiving the brunt of 23.2% of the attacks and reaching a global average of <strong>$4.24M in data breach costs</strong>.</p>

<p>The manufacturing industry lacks cybersecurity maturity, a fact that criminals exploit relentlessly. This is evidenced by the high-stakes burdens placed on supply chains wreaking havoc on the manufacturing industry, which is still recovering from losses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Instrumental to the wellbeing and healthy performance of any manufacturing company, operational technology (OT) supports core-business operations and its safety is essential to ensure sustainable growth and effective means of innovation. For that to happen, cybersecurity needs to be a key, foundational element of any company’s core strategy. High, rigorous security standards and protocols in data, software, and infrastructure coupled with AI-powered solutions allows for process agility and transparency.</p>

<p>Below,  we detail one of the most high-profile cybersecurity attacks of recent years to illustrate how severe and crucial it is for manufacturing companies to take their security environment seriously.</p>

<h3 id="manufacturing-under-threat">Manufacturing under threat</h3>

<p>The manufacturing industry is victim to ransomware, server access, BEC and data theft, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, credential harvesting, and more.</p>

<p>Next, let’s see a high profile case of an attack in action. As the result of a devastating cyberattack involving the LockerGoga ransomware, Norsk Hydro, a multinational aluminum manufacturer with operations in 40 countries, closed many of its plants and was forced to move others offline. The attack compromised the firm’s IT systems across multiple business functions, including the company’s smelting plants in Norway, Qatar, and Brazil. The total cost is estimated at <strong>$75 million</strong>.</p>

<p>As exemplified by the Norsk Hydro case, cybersecurity experts assert that cyber criminals are using more ruthless methods to achieve their objectives and the proficiency of attacks is expected to advance as they continue to develop new methods for cyber attacks. For all industries with OT networks ransomware again led the charge for attack types, accounting for 36% of all attacks and echoing the overall attack trend across all industries. While the IT networks were compromised in the vast majority of these attacks, the impact carried over to victims’ operational technology in many of these instances.</p>

Now more than ever, cybersecurity is extremely relevant for the manufacturing industry. IBM’s X-Force Threat Intelligence Index 2022 report found that manufacturing is the most attacked industry as of 2021, receiving the brunt of 23.2% of the attacks and reaching a global average of $4.24M in data breach costs. The manufacturing industry lacks cybersecurity maturity, a fact that criminals exploit relentlessly. This is evidenced by the high-stakes burdens placed on supply chains wreaking havoc on the manufacturing industry, which is still recovering from losses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Instrumental to the wellbeing and healthy performance of any manufacturing company, operational technology (OT) supports core-business operations and its safety is essential to ensure sustainable growth and effective means of innovation. For that to happen, cybersecurity needs to be a key, foundational element of any company’s core strategy. High, rigorous security standards and protocols in data, software, and infrastructure coupled with AI-powered solutions allows for process agility and transparency. Below, we detail one of the most high-profile cybersecurity attacks of recent years to illustrate how severe and crucial it is for manufacturing companies to take their security environment seriously. Manufacturing under threat The manufacturing industry is victim to ransomware, server access, BEC and data theft, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, credential harvesting, and more. Next, let’s see a high profile case of an attack in action. As the result of a devastating cyberattack involving the LockerGoga ransomware, Norsk Hydro, a multinational aluminum manufacturer with operations in 40 countries, closed many of its plants and was forced to move others offline. The attack compromised the firm’s IT systems across multiple business functions, including the company’s smelting plants in Norway, Qatar, and Brazil. The total cost is estimated at $75 million. As exemplified by the Norsk Hydro case, cybersecurity experts assert that cyber criminals are using more ruthless methods to achieve their objectives and the proficiency of attacks is expected to advance as they continue to develop new methods for cyber attacks. For all industries with OT networks ransomware again led the charge for attack types, accounting for 36% of all attacks and echoing the overall attack trend across all industries. While the IT networks were compromised in the vast majority of these attacks, the impact carried over to victims’ operational technology in many of these instances. Looking at the variety of attacks and the latest cyber criminal developments, the manufacturing industry remains a high-interest target for cybercriminals looking to deploy well-crafted attacks. Cyber attacks are relatively easy for criminals to conduct and are hard to protect against using traditional security technologies.
