The project is part of the <a href="https://www.esa.int/">European Space Agency</a> (ESA) programme of Advanced Research in Telecommunications Systems (<a href="https://www.esa.int/Applications/Telecommunications_Integrated_Applications/ARTES/About_ARTES">ARTES</a>) and will be led by the European Broadcasting Union (<a href="https://www.ebu.ch/home">EBU</a>).</p>

<p>The 5G-EMERGE project aims at developing an integrated satellite and terrestrial system based on open standards to enable high-quality content distribution services over multi-layer IP infra-structures. Telecommunications satellites will efficiently deliver high-demand content, including streaming of live events, as close as possible to the end user – to the ‘edge’. The project includes demonstrations in 5G base stations, users’ homes and vehicles.</p>

<p>A consortium of 20 companies from six European countries will collaborate on developing the distributed edge technology and service-delivery features.</p>

<p>SixSq’s contribution includes leading the demonstration work package and providing the edge-to-cloud software infrastructure based on its <a href="https://nuvla.io/">Nuvla.io</a> B2B SaaS platform and marketplace of containerised applications, as well as its open source NuvlaEdge software.</p>

<p>SixSq CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mebster/">Marc-Elian Bégin</a> said, <em>“Leveraging satellite broadcast and 5G is a great opportunity to deliver the right high-density content at the right location with the right customization. However, this requires fine-tuned orchestration of the entire value chain and this is what SixSq edge-to-cloud software provides. We are no stranger to big challenges posed by ESA and EBU and are looking forward to pushing the boundaries of edge-to-cloud, bringing together the space sector, 5G and multi-media content delivery.”</em></p>

<p><em>“The 5G-Emerge project is yet another example of Ekinops’ long commitment towards software innovation as a mean to add value to the telecommunications sector”</em>, commented <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/muniere/">Vincent Munière</a>, Group Chief Technology Officer &amp; VP R&amp;D at Ekinops. <em>“We are looking forward to helping set the bar in 5G services and content delivery.”</em></p>

<p>For SixSq, this project is a unique opportunity to showcase its edge computing software’s ability to orchestrate complex scenarios for a range of new commercial use-cases, ranging from mari-time, vehicle, public transport, 5G and building applications.  Working with market leaders in their domain, Nuvla.io will manage apps across the edge-to-cloud continuum.</p>

It’s the only way to avoid prying eyes. There’s an important lesson here for organisations collecting data, video and audio — these inputs are your cards and absolutely no one else should see them.</p>

<p>The wealth of information from your sensors, cameras, microphones, actuators and other new digital sources should yield valuable insights without intrusion.</p>

<h3 id="privacy-intrusion-is-a-hot-topic">Privacy intrusion is a hot topic</h3>

<p>When talking with customers, partners and prospects, I’m surprised by how frequently the topic of privacy intrusion comes up, and this is usually part of a broader conversation around the importance of data sovereignty. In Europe, these discussions typically reference the data privacy and security law, the <a href="https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/?cn-reloaded=1">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR), while in the Americas and further afield, other reference points are used to understand and interpret the laws around digital privacy.</p>

<p><strong>What can you see?</strong></p>

<p>As the cost of easy-to-deploy digital source equipment is going down, technical capabilities are going up, so you can understand, see and hear much more from your input streams than ever before. For example, today’s latest video cameras deliver extremely high levels of definition. This is great for generating precise insights on, say, product quality or behavioural analysis – information that’s very valuable to your organisation and to others.</p>

<h3 id="why-keep-this-information-close">Why keep this information close?</h3>

<p>No-one else should be able to see your information, or that of your customers. There are onerous standards and regulations around the operation and management of surveillance equipment, including closed-circuit television (CCTV). These requirements represent such a burden with which most organisations are unwilling or unable to comply. But without adequate protection of the information you gather, there is a very real and growing risk of someone snooping on you.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-avoid-prying-eyes">How to avoid prying eyes?</h3>

<p>A key promise of <a href="/blog/what-is-edge-computing">edge computing</a> is that instead of sending your data, video and audio to the cloud to be processed, you keep it close. All of your input streams are processed locally, near the digital device that generates them. Here’s what you gain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Higher-quality insights: When streams are processed in their entirety near to source, they yield the best possible results. But when streams are transported over the network to the cloud for processing, their quality is normally reduced and this can result in degraded insights.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speedier insights: Your time to insight is faster if you process streams locally – this can be done in real time and without any delays or round trips. Instead, sending streams over the network can cause perturbations and delays, especially if connections are weak and bandwidth is limited. Also as video and audio definition increases, data size increases and journeys to the cloud take longer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Easy data fusion: Because your data is available at the edge, analysis can be easily performed here on all different categories of data (video, audio, etc). An example is analysis both of the sound of a noisy vehicle and images as the vehicle passes, showing its brand, model and number plate. Data fusion such as this enables more powerful analytics – in this case, it could mean better predictive maintenance or regulation enforcement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tighter privacy: The excellent news is that all the above are achieved without privacy intrusion. Why would you want to move, process and store privacy-sensitive data in the cloud – which, by the way, additionally requires designing and managing a whole layer of cloud privacy applications? Instead with edge computing the same information stays local and is stripped from any data that might intrude on citizen or corporate privacy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Better control: With edge computing, you call the shots. A <a href="https://nuvla.io/">well-managed edge computing solution</a> puts you in remote control, able to update the devices and apps running at the edge, aligned with your changing needs. So as your organisation evolves, so too can your edge computing strategy.</p>

<p>You can find many, many <a href="https://media.sixsq.com/blog/what-is-a-smart-city">smart cities</a> that share a common architecture. They have one or many sensors producing data. And this data needs to be processed in real time to provide insights, either to take action or to predict trends.</p>

<p>Let me introduce you to the fascinating work we’re doing in the Swiss city of Geneva, partnering with <a href="https://securaxis.com/">Securaxis</a>, who provide sound analytics for smart cities, <a href="https://www.hesge.ch/hepia/">HEPIA</a>, Geneva’s university of landscape, engineering and architecture, and HEG, the city’s school of business administration. In the context of the <a href="https://www.hesge.ch/hepia/recherche-developpement/projets-recherche/en-cours/medina">MEDInA</a> project, we’re using the Securaxis SONAL machine learning app to measure sound so we can monitor and categorise traffic. We’re also using cameras and more machine learning from <a href="https://www.hesge.ch/heg/">HEG</a> to understand traffic lanes. Combined, this provides valuable real-time insights into traffic flow and helps to control street lighting to provide safer streets while saving energy.</p>

<p>Another example comes from the gorgeous Italian <a href="https://www.cittametropolitana.fi.it/">City of Florence</a> where, in the context of the <a href="https://elastic-project.eu/">ELASTIC</a> project, with partners such as <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/transport">Thales</a> providing smart sensors for transportation, <a href="https://www.bsc.es/">Barcelona Supercomputing Center</a>, <a href="https://informationcatalyst.com/">ICE</a> and <a href="https://www.ikerlan.es/en/">Ikerlan</a>, we are providing a range of new services on the city’s tram network. One of these services is predictive maintenance – we use laser scanners on the rails to monitor rail profile degradation to predict the need for maintenance operations. Another is synchronisation of traffic intersections to favour public transport traffic while minimising impact on all other traffic. And a third is providing proactive driver assistance with real-time emergency alerts in case of intrusion onto the tram path.</p>

<h2 id="but-what-are-the-really-smart-cities-doing">But what are the really smart cities doing?</h2>

<p>The really smart cities do more than share a common architecture. The also share edge infrastructure.</p>

<p>Their IT architectural anatomy includes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Sensors</li>
  <li>Processing unit (an edge device)</li>
  <li>Communication (to enable edge-to-cloud and/or edge-to-edge)</li>
  <li>Cloud (to aggregate information)</li>
  <li>And of course apps or algorithms (to process data and take actions)</li>
</ol>

<p>It is extremely wasteful to replicate this architecture for each and every use case – all the applications mentioned above plus many more, such as measuring air quality and monitoring temperature and sound pollution.</p>

<p>Think of the energy consumed in manufacturing all this redundant hardware… and the energy needed to power it. And what if new use cases come along that require mixing or fusing different data (say, audio and video to identify the source of traffic accidents or noisy or polluting vehicles)? If everything is built in silos, interoperability is much harder, and with independent systems there can be no cost sharing and only limited economies of scale to improve the ROI.</p>

<h2 id="sharing-edge-infrastructure-to-take-actions-in-real-time">Sharing edge infrastructure to take actions in real time</h2>
<p>Instead, what makes much more sense is to use a shared edge infrastructure. This means that sensors are connected to a multi-tenant edge computing unit, able to host several apps or algorithms, connected to a range of sensors. It also means the unit can create many insights which enable the city to take actions in real time.</p>

<p>Further, once smart city operators are able to remotely control this architecture it becomes much more future proof. Updates, upgrades and even new use cases can be deployed with minimal, if any, intrusion into the smart city physical infrastructure.</p>

<h2 id="intelligent-infrastructure--common-sense">Intelligent Infrastructure = common sense</h2>
<p>In North America, people are starting to describe this type of shared edge infrastructure for smart cities as ‘Intelligent Infrastructure’. I call it common sense, since cities must evolve quickly to provide citizens with the level of services they require.</p>

<p>The climate emergency is also accelerating the need for such architecture, since public transport systems must become more inclusive, delivering a greater sense of security along with higher performance. Understanding the impact of inescapable rising temperatures is also essential and, for this, situational awareness and behaviour trend analysis are key.

They have one or many sensors producing data. And this data needs to be processed in real time to provide insights, either to take action or to predict trends. Let me introduce you to the fascinating work we’re doing in the Swiss city of Geneva, partnering with Securaxis, who provide sound analytics for smart cities, HEPIA, Geneva’s university of landscape, engineering and architecture, and HEG, the city’s school of business administration. In the context of the MEDInA project, we’re using the Securaxis SONAL machine learning app to measure sound so we can monitor and categorise traffic. We’re also using cameras and more machine learning from HEG to understand traffic lanes. Combined, this provides valuable real-time insights into traffic flow and helps to control street lighting to provide safer streets while saving energy. Another example comes from the gorgeous Italian City of Florence where, in the context of the ELASTIC project, with partners such as Thales providing smart sensors for transportation, Barcelona Supercomputing Center, ICE and Ikerlan, we are providing a range of new services on the city’s tram network. One of these services is predictive maintenance – we use laser scanners on the rails to monitor rail profile degradation to predict the need for maintenance operations. Another is synchronisation of traffic intersections to favour public transport traffic while minimising impact on all other traffic. And a third is providing proactive driver assistance with real-time emergency alerts in case of intrusion onto the tram path. But what are the really smart cities doing? The really smart cities do more than share a common architecture. The also share edge infrastructure. Their IT architectural anatomy includes: Sensors Processing unit (an edge device) Communication (to enable edge-to-cloud and/or edge-to-edge) Cloud (to aggregate information) And of course apps or algorithms (to process data and take actions) It is extremely wasteful to replicate this architecture for each and every use case – all the applications mentioned above plus many more, such as measuring air quality and monitoring temperature and sound pollution. Think of the energy consumed in manufacturing all this redundant hardware… and the energy needed to power it. And what if new use cases come along that require mixing or fusing different data (say, audio and video to identify the source of traffic accidents or noisy or polluting vehicles)? If everything is built in silos, interoperability is much harder, and with independent systems there can be no cost sharing and only limited economies of scale to improve the ROI. Sharing edge infrastructure to take actions in real time Instead, what makes much more sense is to use a shared edge infrastructure. This means that sensors are connected to a multi-tenant edge computing unit, able to host several apps or algorithms, connected to a range of sensors. It also means the unit can create many insights which enable the city to take actions in real time. Further, once smart city operators are able to remotely control this architecture it becomes much more future proof. Updates, upgrades and even new use cases can be deployed with minimal, if any, intrusion into the smart city physical infrastructure. Intelligent Infrastructure = common sense In North America, people are starting to describe this type of shared edge infrastructure for smart cities as ‘Intelligent Infrastructure’. I call it common sense, since cities must evolve quickly to provide citizens with the level of services they require. The climate emergency is also accelerating the need for such architecture, since public transport systems must become more inclusive, delivering a greater sense of security along with higher performance. Understanding the impact of inescapable rising temperatures is also essential and, for this, situational awareness and behaviour trend analysis are key. As discussed in previous blogs, only edge computing is capable of doing all this while also protecting citizen privacy.

Read on for tips and potential pitfalls.</h4>

<p>A pilot entering cloudy, turbulent skies is effectively flying blind. It’s a critical situation. Every moment that ticks by without clear visibility means things can change and danger levels increase. It may become impossible to reach the destination airport. Data is needed immediately – facts about the aircraft, its status, position, nearby hazards, and weather conditions – so the pilot is able to proceed without guesswork and regain full control.</p>

<p>As a private pilot, I know a lot about airplanes but I’d never trust myself to build one and take to the skies! A do-it-yourself (DIY) solution – even one made from excellent parts – carries too much risk. I feel the same is true for edge computing.</p>

<p>Too many times, I’ve seen DIY edge solutions fail. Companies realise too late the downsides of unbudgeted cost, protracted time to readiness and operational complexity. And they clip their own wings by sacrificing system reliability and evolvability.</p>

<p>I guess people are tempted to self-build because edge computing seems similar to cloud computing. Sure, they share several attributes but they’re also very different.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/blog/airplanes.png" alt="airplanes" /></p>

<p class="caption">Through my aeroclub, I’m not limited to flying just one type of aircraft. I like to keep my options open.</p>

<p>Take, for example, the physical environment. Cloud computing happens in highly controlled locations with easy-to-access servers. But the edge is challenged by temperature and humidity changes, dust and vibration. Unregulated settings get power and network jitters, have more cyber-security risk and can be complex to access.</p>

<p>Instead of a DIY edge solution, some organisations ask a vertical solution provider to solve a specific use case. The danger here is a significant investment with little flexibility in the future. As business needs evolve, the original solution may not adapt. A flexibility promise might be made but it will be on the provider’s terms, with limited powers of negotiation.</p>

<p>An obvious alternative is a cloud-first approach. Start with a cloud from one of the hyperscalers (Amazon, Microsoft Azure or Google) or a private cloud, and deploy at the edge as mandated. <strong>Warning!</strong> There is a conflict of interest. While you seek the best possible edge outcomes, these providers are in the business of selling compute and storage. They want you to pump as much data as possible to the cloud. So you’ll miss what’s arguably the <a href="/blog/free-your-business-critical-data-from-the-cloud">No.1 benefit of edge computing</a>: processing raw data near its source.</p>

<p>Cloud-first can work for simple deployments but – once again – you risk clipping your own wings. As your business needs grow in scale and sophistication (trust me, they will), a cloud approach quickly limits your ability to expand. At which point, you may regret putting all your eggs in the same cloud basket.</p>

<p>So the optimal approach is edge-first and cloud-neutral. This aims to privilege the edge (instead of the cloud) because this is where you act on your data. An edge-first solution does not limit your ability to process, transform, aggregate and anonymise the data. On the contrary, it generally empowers developers with a wide range of tools (including machine learning) to take full advantage of the data produced at the edge and act on it. And you do all this on your own terms while also leveraging the unlimited processing power and storage of the cloud. You get the best of both worlds – edge and cloud.</p>

<p>Another way to keep your options open, ensuring the most future-proof edge experience, is to select a provider offering <a href="https://nuvla.io">OPEX</a> over CAPEX. Added to this, edge-first providers are likely to help you deploy a shared infrastructure strategy. This allows several old and new apps from different sources to run alongside each other at the edge, which is likely to generate a very attractive return on investment.</p>

<p>One final thought. <strong>Data sovereignty</strong> matters. Keeping tight control of where your data gets processed is strategic for many organisations. A key decision is which parts of your data will be processed at the edge and which in the cloud. The solution you select must give you the right level of control over your data flows.</p>
