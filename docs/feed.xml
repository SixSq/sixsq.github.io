<p>Now more than ever, cybersecurity is extremely relevant for the manufacturing industry. IBM’s X-Force Threat Intelligence Index 2022 report found that manufacturing is the most attacked industry as of 2021, receiving the brunt of 23.2% of the attacks and reaching a global average of <strong>$4.24M in data breach costs</strong>.</p>

<p>The manufacturing industry lacks cybersecurity maturity, a fact that criminals exploit relentlessly. This is evidenced by the high-stakes burdens placed on supply chains wreaking havoc on the manufacturing industry, which is still recovering from losses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Instrumental to the wellbeing and healthy performance of any manufacturing company, operational technology (OT) supports core-business operations and its safety is essential to ensure sustainable growth and effective means of innovation. For that to happen, cybersecurity needs to be a key, foundational element of any company’s core strategy. High, rigorous security standards and protocols in data, software, and infrastructure coupled with AI-powered solutions allows for process agility and transparency.</p>

<p>Below,  we detail one of the most high-profile cybersecurity attacks of recent years to illustrate how severe and crucial it is for manufacturing companies to take their security environment seriously.</p>

<h3 id="manufacturing-under-threat">Manufacturing under threat</h3>

<p>The manufacturing industry is victim to ransomware, server access, BEC and data theft, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, credential harvesting, and more.</p>

<p>Next, let’s see a high profile case of an attack in action. As the result of a devastating cyberattack involving the LockerGoga ransomware, Norsk Hydro, a multinational aluminum manufacturer with operations in 40 countries, closed many of its plants and was forced to move others offline. The attack compromised the firm’s IT systems across multiple business functions, including the company’s smelting plants in Norway, Qatar, and Brazil. The total cost is estimated at <strong>$75 million</strong>.</p>

<p>As exemplified by the Norsk Hydro case, cybersecurity experts assert that cyber criminals are using more ruthless methods to achieve their objectives and the proficiency of attacks is expected to advance as they continue to develop new methods for cyber attacks. For all industries with OT networks ransomware again led the charge for attack types, accounting for 36% of all attacks and echoing the overall attack trend across all industries. While the IT networks were compromised in the vast majority of these attacks, the impact carried over to victims’ operational technology in many of these instances.</p>

<p>Looking at the variety of attacks and the latest cyber criminal developments, the manufacturing industry remains a high-interest target for cybercriminals looking to deploy well-crafted attacks. Cyber attacks are relatively easy for criminals to conduct and are hard to protect against using traditional security technologies.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-an-ai-powered-solution-advance-your-edgeiot-cyber-security">How can an AI-powered solution advance your Edge/IoT cyber security?</h2>

<p>Cyber security is more important than ever before, as the attack surface area has increased due to the latest wave of digital transformation that is enhancing business agility and developing new customer experiences. When it comes to the security of Edge and IoT infrastructures, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and deep reinforcement learning are unmatched.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://edgelabs.ai/platform/">AI EdgeLabs platform</a> is embedded with a proprietary network telemetry and monitoring sensor that protects every layer of an Edge and IoT architecture. The AI-powered solution delivers smart means to detect anomalies that signal the presence of threats, threat intelligence software with powerful analytics tools for robust traffic inspection, and swift incident response and remediation.</p>

<p>During its deployment on-premises (on the factory side), the AI EdgeLabs Sensor runs a configurable set of security checks and topology research to collect the initial context of your environment. Data collected from the sensor is analyzed by the AI EdgeLabs platform that provides a set of AI-based models that are pre-trained on the existing knowledge base of threat patterns and attack signatures.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/blog/Manufacturing scheme.png" alt="AI EdgeLabs platform" style="max-width: 700px" /></p>

<p>Looking at the graph above, we can see the SCADA power system. The electrical distribution system consists of controllers, sensors, and operator-interface points.</p>

<p>For real-time monitoring and controlling of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), the system uses circuit breakers and power monitors. Data is transmitted from PLCs and other devices to a computer-based SCADA node located on each sub-station.</p>

<p>One or more computers can be located on different points. The AI EdgeLabs Sensor can be implemented on each computer-based SCADA node to protect the whole system. This includes factory machines, HMIs, sensors, and end devices, protecting them from malfunctioning, data modifying, injection attacks such as SQL injection and other forms of advanced malware.</p>

<p>The EdgeLabs Sensor helps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Generate near-realtime visibility of infrastructure and application performance;</li>
  <li>Prevent and block threat sources in real-time;</li>
  <li>Integrate cloud-based and on-premises application performance monitoring;</li>
  <li>Monitor SaaS applications from your users’ vantage point;</li>
  <li>Monitor IaaS resources from your users’ vantage point.</li>
</ul>

<p>The AI EdgeLabs platform equips your security teams with multi-layered threat intelligence software, advanced network visibility, and automated remediation to protect every asset, device, server, or network element of your manufacturing environment.</p>

<p>With AI EdgeLabs available in the <a href="https://sixsq.com/marketplace">Nuvla Marketplace</a>, companies now have an easier way to cyber protect their edge assets. Indeed all edge devices, servers and virtual machines running the NuvleEdge software can now be protected using the AI EdgeLabs software, providing a 1-click cyber protection to all sectors of the economy concerned by edge computing.

It’s the only way to avoid prying eyes. There’s an important lesson here for organisations collecting data, video and audio — these inputs are your cards and absolutely no one else should see them.</p>

<p>The wealth of information from your sensors, cameras, microphones, actuators and other new digital sources should yield valuable insights without intrusion.</p>

<h3 id="privacy-intrusion-is-a-hot-topic">Privacy intrusion is a hot topic</h3>

<p>When talking with customers, partners and prospects, I’m surprised by how frequently the topic of privacy intrusion comes up, and this is usually part of a broader conversation around the importance of data sovereignty. In Europe, these discussions typically reference the data privacy and security law, the <a href="https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/?cn-reloaded=1">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR), while in the Americas and further afield, other reference points are used to understand and interpret the laws around digital privacy.</p>

<p><strong>What can you see?</strong></p>

<p>As the cost of easy-to-deploy digital source equipment is going down, technical capabilities are going up, so you can understand, see and hear much more from your input streams than ever before. For example, today’s latest video cameras deliver extremely high levels of definition. This is great for generating precise insights on, say, product quality or behavioural analysis – information that’s very valuable to your organisation and to others.</p>

<h3 id="why-keep-this-information-close">Why keep this information close?</h3>

<p>No-one else should be able to see your information, or that of your customers. There are onerous standards and regulations around the operation and management of surveillance equipment, including closed-circuit television (CCTV). These requirements represent such a burden with which most organisations are unwilling or unable to comply. But without adequate protection of the information you gather, there is a very real and growing risk of someone snooping on you.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-avoid-prying-eyes">How to avoid prying eyes?</h3>

<p>A key promise of <a href="/blog/discover/2019/11/08/what-is-edge-computing">edge computing</a> is that instead of sending your data, video and audio to the cloud to be processed, you keep it close. All of your input streams are processed locally, near the digital device that generates them. Here’s what you gain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Higher-quality insights: When streams are processed in their entirety near to source, they yield the best possible results. But when streams are transported over the network to the cloud for processing, their quality is normally reduced and this can result in degraded insights.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speedier insights: Your time to insight is faster if you process streams locally – this can be done in real time and without any delays or round trips. Instead, sending streams over the network can cause perturbations and delays, especially if connections are weak and bandwidth is limited. Also as video and audio definition increases, data size increases and journeys to the cloud take longer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Easy data fusion: Because your data is available at the edge, analysis can be easily performed here on all different categories of data (video, audio, etc). An example is analysis both of the sound of a noisy vehicle and images as the vehicle passes, showing its brand, model and number plate. Data fusion such as this enables more powerful analytics – in this case, it could mean better predictive maintenance or regulation enforcement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tighter privacy: The excellent news is that all the above are achieved without privacy intrusion. Why would you want to move, process and store privacy-sensitive data in the cloud – which, by the way, additionally requires designing and managing a whole layer of cloud privacy applications? Instead with edge computing the same information stays local and is stripped from any data that might intrude on citizen or corporate privacy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Better control: With edge computing, you call the shots. A <a href="https://nuvla.io/">well-managed edge computing solution</a> puts you in remote control, able to update the devices and apps running at the edge, aligned with your changing needs. So as your organisation evolves, so too can your edge computing strategy.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

For example, today’s latest video cameras deliver extremely high levels of definition. This is great for generating precise insights on, say, product quality or behavioural analysis – information that’s very valuable to your organisation and to others. Why keep this information close? No-one else should be able to see your information, or that of your customers. There are onerous standards and regulations around the operation and management of surveillance equipment, including closed-circuit television (CCTV). These requirements represent such a burden with which most organisations are unwilling or unable to comply. But without adequate protection of the information you gather, there is a very real and growing risk of someone snooping on you. How to avoid prying eyes? A key promise of edge computing is that instead of sending your data, video and audio to the cloud to be processed, you keep it close. All of your input streams are processed locally, near the digital device that generates them. Here’s what you gain: Higher-quality insights: When streams are processed in their entirety near to source, they yield the best possible results. But when streams are transported over the network to the cloud for processing, their quality is normally reduced and this can result in degraded insights. Speedier insights: Your time to insight is faster if you process streams locally – this can be done in real time and without any delays or round trips. Instead, sending streams over the network can cause perturbations and delays, especially if connections are weak and bandwidth is limited. Also as video and audio definition increases, data size increases and journeys to the cloud take longer. Easy data fusion: Because your data is available at the edge, analysis can be easily performed here on all different categories of data (video, audio, etc). An example is analysis both of the sound of a noisy vehicle and images as the vehicle passes, showing its brand, model and number plate. Data fusion such as this enables more powerful analytics – in this case, it could mean better predictive maintenance or regulation enforcement. Tighter privacy: The excellent news is that all the above are achieved without privacy intrusion. Why would you want to move, process and store privacy-sensitive data in the cloud – which, by the way, additionally requires designing and managing a whole layer of cloud privacy applications? Instead with edge computing the same information stays local and is stripped from any data that might intrude on citizen or corporate privacy. Better control: With edge computing, you call the shots. A well-managed edge computing solution puts you in remote control, able to update the devices and apps running at the edge, aligned with your changing needs. So as your organisation evolves, so too can your edge computing strategy. Want to see more from us? At SixSq, we have a wealth of experience in privacy protection.

<p>You can find many, many smart cities that share a common architecture. They have one or many sensors producing data. And this data needs to be processed in real time to provide insights, either to take action or to predict trends.</p>

<p>Let me introduce you to the fascinating work we’re doing in the Swiss city of Geneva, partnering with <a href="https://securaxis.com/">Securaxis</a>, who provide sound analytics for smart cities, <a href="https://www.hesge.ch/hepia/">HEPIA</a>, Geneva’s university of landscape, engineering and architecture, and HEG, the city’s school of business administration. In the context of the <a href="https://www.hesge.ch/hepia/recherche-developpement/projets-recherche/en-cours/medina">MEDInA</a> project, we’re using the Securaxis SONAL machine learning app to measure sound so we can monitor and categorise traffic. We’re also using cameras and more machine learning from <a href="https://www.hesge.ch/heg/">HEG</a> to understand traffic lanes. Combined, this provides valuable real-time insights into traffic flow and helps to control street lighting to provide safer streets while saving energy.</p>

<p>Another example comes from the gorgeous Italian <a href="https://www.cittametropolitana.fi.it/">City of Florence</a> where, in the context of the <a href="https://elastic-project.eu/">ELASTIC</a> project, with partners such as <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/transport">Thales</a> providing smart sensors for transportation, <a href="https://www.bsc.es/">Barcelona Supercomputing Center</a>, <a href="https://informationcatalyst.com/">ICE</a> and <a href="https://www.ikerlan.es/en/">Ikerlan</a>, we are providing a range of new services on the city’s tram network. One of these services is predictive maintenance – we use laser scanners on the rails to monitor rail profile degradation to predict the need for maintenance operations. Another is synchronisation of traffic intersections to favour public transport traffic while minimising impact on all other traffic. And a third is providing proactive driver assistance with real-time emergency alerts in case of intrusion onto the tram path.</p>

<h2 id="but-what-are-the-really-smart-cities-doing">But what are the really smart cities doing?</h2>

<p>The really smart cities do more than share a common architecture. The also share edge infrastructure.</p>

<p>Their IT architectural anatomy includes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Sensors</li>
  <li>Processing unit (an edge device)</li>
  <li>Communication (to enable edge-to-cloud and/or edge-to-edge)</li>
  <li>Cloud (to aggregate information)</li>
  <li>And of course apps or algorithms (to process data and take actions)</li>
</ol>

<p>It is extremely wasteful to replicate this architecture for each and every use case – all the applications mentioned above plus many more, such as measuring air quality and monitoring temperature and sound pollution.</p>

<p>Think of the energy consumed in manufacturing all this redundant hardware… and the energy needed to power it. And what if new use cases come along that require mixing or fusing different data (say, audio and video to identify the source of traffic accidents or noisy or polluting vehicles)? If everything is built in silos, interoperability is much harder, and with independent systems there can be no cost sharing and only limited economies of scale to improve the ROI.</p>

<h2 id="sharing-edge-infrastructure-to-take-actions-in-real-time">Sharing edge infrastructure to take actions in real time</h2>
<p>Instead, what makes much more sense is to use a shared edge infrastructure. This means that sensors are connected to a multi-tenant edge computing unit, able to host several apps or algorithms, connected to a range of sensors. It also means the unit can create many insights which enable the city to take actions in real time.</p>

<p>Further, once smart city operators are able to remotely control this architecture it becomes much more future proof. Updates, upgrades and even new use cases can be deployed with minimal, if any, intrusion into the smart city physical infrastructure.</p>

<h2 id="intelligent-infrastructure--common-sense">Intelligent Infrastructure = common sense</h2>
<p>In North America, people are starting to describe this type of shared edge infrastructure for smart cities as ‘Intelligent Infrastructure’. I call it common sense, since cities must evolve quickly to provide citizens with the level of services they require.</p>

<p>The climate emergency is also accelerating the need for such architecture, since public transport systems must become more inclusive, delivering a greater sense of security along with higher performance. Understanding the impact of inescapable rising temperatures is also essential and, for this, situational awareness and behaviour trend analysis are key. As discussed in previous blogs, only edge computing is capable of doing all this while also protecting citizen privacy.</p>
