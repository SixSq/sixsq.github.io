From tracking and serialisation to inventory management and health and safety protocols, the applications of computer vision are vast and transformative.</p>

    <p>However, the volume of data produced by cameras and similar sensors is significant. For example, a single 4K camera recording colour images at 60 FPS (frames per second) produces approximately 1 TB of data per day. Yet, accurate analysis often requires this type of high-fidelity video images. It is therefore not viable to perform this type of analysis in the cloud since it would require sending vast amounts of data over the wide area network. Further, network interruptions would have a direct negative impact on business continuity.</p>

    <p>The solution is to process the video and potentially audio streams locally, at the edge, in this case on or near the factory floor. By using an edge-to-cloud management platform like SixSq’s <a href="/platform">Nuvla.io</a>, the safe, easy-to-use hardware-agnostic, cloud-neutral and container native ecosystem, companies can simplify the management and monitoring of the production process.

I should know; I’ve had a hand in building rockets! But nor is it a walk in the park.</p>

<p>In this blog, I’ll share my experiences of building, deploying, and operating intelligent apps (let’s call them <strong>ML apps</strong>) at the edge – in other words, in the physical world that’s outside the data centre.</p>

<p>Just before take-off, a couple of basics. Your ML apps need a stable and secure infrastructure incorporating the near-edge or far-edge or both. They also need high-quality data which must be pre-processed to retain its rich context. And they must be easy to deploy, redeploy and operate.</p>

<h3 id="whos-on-board">Who’s on board?</h3>

<p>So, who should be on board to run your ML apps (let’s call this activity <strong>ML ops</strong>)? It’s helpful to think of three groups of people – some of whom belong to your organisation and others who are partners or provide consulting services to your organisation. They are the <strong>IT team</strong>, <strong>the data scientists</strong> and <strong>the business folk</strong>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The IT team</strong>: What are these people up to? They’re working hard to provide a <strong>stable and secure edge-to-cloud infrastructure</strong>, needing full visibility of the edge especially if there are physical and/or cyber risks. If something goes wrong, these people need to know immediately.</p>

    <p>These techies like to select ML apps according to their intended purpose. If a new ML app will be critical to local business processes, the IT team picks one capable of functioning locally at the edge (it delivers business continuity). If the new ML app will be used for overall management, monitoring or trending analysis, the team picks one that can communicate with the wider world to provide an overview (it delivers business availability).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The data scientists</strong>: What do these people want? A <strong>massive, central warehouse of well-organised, high-quality data</strong> that’s easily queryable and downloadable. This is the liquid hydrogen essential to every rocket launch!</p>

    <p>Over the years, I’ve talked to many data scientists working in transportation (and many other industries) here on Planet Earth. They all say very similar things  <em>“90% of failing AI projects fail because of data-related issues,”</em> <em>“Data is the hardest part of machine learning and the most important to get right”</em> (Uber), and  <em>“No other activity in the machine learning lifecycle has a higher return on investment than improving the data a model has access to”</em> (Gojek).</p>

    <p>What else could knock your ML ops off-course? Data scientists insist high-quality data includes context – the “where, when and how” of its collection, also known as its metadata – information that must be packaged and stored alongside data wherever it travels.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The business folk</strong>: These people make significant demands: they want <strong>fluid deployment and operation of ML apps</strong>. They want everything immediately and want to make changes almost daily – whatever it takes to solve business problems and remain agile in a competitive market.</p>

    <p>Needing to deploy new ML apps all the time can bring business folk into conflict with the  IT team. In most business cases, there’s not a single app vendor or creator capable of fulfilling all requirements, so the business team wants the freedom to compose its own bouquet of apps, from different sources – a risk for the IT team who are tasked with minimising ML ops costs and maintaining clear T&amp;Cs, SLAs, support services, pricing and more. This also introduces more work. Training and deploying each new ML app is not one-shot task because the physical world changes and evolves, so ML app models require regular re-training, from regularly updated data, and regular re-deployment.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="which-launch-pad">Which launch pad?</h3>

<p>Whoever takes the decision about how to run AI at the edge, it’s important to keep in mind the varying needs of the IT team, data scientists and business folk.</p>

<p>Hyperscalers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) are attracting attention right now, so one of these might seem the right choice. But hyperscale providers have a cloud-first business model. This means they focus on selling cloud storage and compute resources and giving access to tools for data exploration as well as AI and ML model training.</p>

<p>The triumvirate rocket crew would do better with an edge-first solution. Only this puts them all in full control of their data processing chain – from data capture, crunching and training, right back to inference (aka running the model on fresh data). And only an edge-first solution can deliver the required level of maturity, control and flexibility.</p>

<h3 id="why-edge-first">Why edge-first?</h3>

<p>Thinking about the infrastructure level, edge-first allows you to adopt container technology at the edge. Your IT team will be able to re-use, re-purpose and modernise many existing infrastructures, knowledge and processes. Edge-first also allows you to operate different types and generations of assets and devices at the edge in a coherent way. You can manage them with secure and intelligent edge computing software like our hardware-agnostic, container-native NuvlaEdge software.</p>

<p>Thinking about your data needs, edge-first allows you to use an edge-to-cloud management platform, such as our B2B SaaS <a href="/platform">Nuvla.io,</a> to accelerate app deployment at the edge, reducing risk, removing management complexity and delivering full control over data. For companies operating in a regulated industry, there’s an on-premises version of Nuvla.io.</p>

<p>Once curated, the data can be pushed to your favourite backend service. For example, Nuvla.io will deliver the data to your own servers, Amazon’s, Azure’s or Google’s. We also provide this service from Switzerland. What’s important here is your data scientists get easy and safe access to their rocket fuel!</p>

<p>Thinking about ML app deployment and operation, an edge-first management platform is likely to support apps from multiple vendors and third parties. Our Nuvla.io platform certainly does, while also providing an excellent selection of ML apps and app bundles in the <a href="/marketplace">Nuvla.io Marketplace</a>. This allows your organisation to move fast while controlling risks.</p>

Do you think <strong>urgent intervention</strong> is required? If it’s midsummer and the cabinet is located on the French Riviera, probably not. But if these temperature readings are collected around midnight from a cabinet at the top of the Matterhorn, certainly yes!</p>

<h3 id="data-context-is-crucial">Data context is crucial</h3>

<p>The issue here is context. Fundamental to your own understanding is not just having an abundance of high-quality data (although this is essential) but also knowing the context of this data – the <strong>“where”</strong>, <strong>“when”</strong> and <strong>“how”</strong> of the information. It’s fundamental to artificial intelligence (AI) systems too. Having both high volumes and full context achieves data that is actionable and trustworthy for AI analysis.</p>

<h3 id="the-underlying-challenge">The underlying challenge</h3>

<p>There’s an underlying challenge to this. AI and machine learning (ML) training typically takes place in cloud or data center environments; this is because training makes heavy computational and storage demands. However, by the time data arrives in the cloud or data center, its context may have been lost (the AI system can’t tell its French Riviera from its Matterhorn) and typically it is too late to rebuild this context.</p>

<p>This has a negative impact on data quality and prevents effective comparison and exploitation of the data, especially over time. Fortunately, there’s now an innovative solution to this challenge.</p>

<h3 id="the-role-of-customer-premises-equipment-cpe">The role of customer-premises equipment (CPE)</h3>

<p>Today’s <strong>customer-premises equipment (CPE) can run sophisticated software</strong> to facilitate data collection, using AI/ML or traditional methods, at the edge along with highly secure data transmission to the cloud or data center for training purposes. Once trained, models can be deployed at the edge, Before transmission, performing AI/ML analyses on this local, real-time data – the network edge is the optimal place for AI/ML systems to render decisions (inference), gathering all the context that’s required.</p>

<p>Enabled by over-the-air deployment capabilities, software-enabled CPE can become a set of pivotal assets for implementing AI/ML strategies at the network edge.</p>

<h6 id="for-any-telecom-organization-seeking-ai-strategy-enhancement--particularly-for-geographically-dispersed-companies--this-represents-a-huge-opportunity-each-organization-can-use-existing-cpe-investments-and-infrastructure-to-advance-its-ai-strategy">For any telecom organization seeking AI strategy enhancement – particularly for geographically dispersed companies – this represents a huge opportunity. Each organization can use existing CPE investments and infrastructure to advance its AI strategy.</h6>

<h3 id="introducing-a-comprehensive-solution">Introducing a comprehensive solution</h3>

<p>The <a href="/platform">Nuvla.io </a> platform, developed by SixSq and a part of <a href="https://www.ekinops.com/">Ekinops</a>, offers an all-encompassing solution for managing CPE. This platform supports local data processing, enables secure data transfer and integrates data science tools, featuring:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Data lakes: Simplified management of unstructured data using cloud object storage, with a metadata catalog for easy navigation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Data warehouses: Efficient handling of structured data through time-series databases and metadata catalogs, making data easy to use for AI training</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Edge data retrieval: Leverages standard equipment for data capture and processing, enabling both cloud storage and edge computing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Contextual integrity: Guarantees data integrity and provenance, essential for reliable AI-driven insights</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Edge AI inference: performing AI/ML analysis at the edge, near the source of, and where decisions matter</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To maximize flexibility and foster innovation, the Nuvla.io platform supports a diverse array of applications: open source, proprietary and custom. This ensures seamless integration into the ecosystem without the need for extensive app redevelopment.</p>

<p>Embedded in <a href="https://www.ekinops.com/products-services/products/oneaccess/ucpe">Ekinops’ next-gen CPE</a>, Nuvla.io kickstarts a robust AI/ML strategy for businesses.</p>

<h3 id="practical-application-at-the-edge">Practical application at the edge</h3>

<p>There are many ways in which CPE-powered AI strategies can enhance edge computing capabilities.</p>

<p>An important example is in telecom operations. Utilizing SNMP probes, the telecom organization can collect extensive data on <strong>CPE performance and system health</strong> and use this to train AI support agents to provide proactive customer support and optimize customer service levels.

Do you think urgent intervention is required? If it’s midsummer and the cabinet is located on the French Riviera, probably not. But if these temperature readings are collected around midnight from a cabinet at the top of the Matterhorn, certainly yes! Data context is crucial The issue here is context. Fundamental to your own understanding is not just having an abundance of high-quality data (although this is essential) but also knowing the context of this data – the “where”, “when” and “how” of the information. It’s fundamental to artificial intelligence (AI) systems too. Having both high volumes and full context achieves data that is actionable and trustworthy for AI analysis. The underlying challenge There’s an underlying challenge to this. AI and machine learning (ML) training typically takes place in cloud or data center environments; this is because training makes heavy computational and storage demands. However, by the time data arrives in the cloud or data center, its context may have been lost (the AI system can’t tell its French Riviera from its Matterhorn) and typically it is too late to rebuild this context. This has a negative impact on data quality and prevents effective comparison and exploitation of the data, especially over time. Fortunately, there’s now an innovative solution to this challenge. The role of customer-premises equipment (CPE) Today’s customer-premises equipment (CPE) can run sophisticated software to facilitate data collection, using AI/ML or traditional methods, at the edge along with highly secure data transmission to the cloud or data center for training purposes. Once trained, models can be deployed at the edge, Before transmission, performing AI/ML analyses on this local, real-time data – the network edge is the optimal place for AI/ML systems to render decisions (inference), gathering all the context that’s required. Enabled by over-the-air deployment capabilities, software-enabled CPE can become a set of pivotal assets for implementing AI/ML strategies at the network edge. For any telecom organization seeking AI strategy enhancement – particularly for geographically dispersed companies – this represents a huge opportunity. Each organization can use existing CPE investments and infrastructure to advance its AI strategy. Introducing a comprehensive solution The Nuvla.io platform, developed by SixSq and a part of Ekinops, offers an all-encompassing solution for managing CPE. This platform supports local data processing, enables secure data transfer and integrates data science tools, featuring: Data lakes: Simplified management of unstructured data using cloud object storage, with a metadata catalog for easy navigation Data warehouses: Efficient handling of structured data through time-series databases and metadata catalogs, making data easy to use for AI training Edge data retrieval: Leverages standard equipment for data capture and processing, enabling both cloud storage and edge computing Contextual integrity: Guarantees data integrity and provenance, essential for reliable AI-driven insights Edge AI inference: performing AI/ML analysis at the edge, near the source of, and where decisions matter To maximize flexibility and foster innovation, the Nuvla.io platform supports a diverse array of applications: open source, proprietary and custom. This ensures seamless integration into the ecosystem without the need for extensive app redevelopment. Embedded in Ekinops’ next-gen CPE, Nuvla.io kickstarts a robust AI/ML strategy for businesses. Practical application at the edge There are many ways in which CPE-powered AI strategies can enhance edge computing capabilities. An important example is in telecom operations. Utilizing SNMP probes, the telecom organization can collect extensive data on CPE performance and system health and use this to train AI support agents to provide proactive customer support and optimize customer service levels. Once these virtual agents are trained and deployed on CPE, there’s no further need to transmit data to the cloud. Instead, data is analyzed locally and, only when required, the operator can receive summaries and alerts. Similarly, thinking about energy management, the telecom organization can gather essential data by measuring power consumption or inferring it through temperature metrics.

<h3 id="utilities-and-energy-providers">Utilities and Energy Providers</h3>

<p>Energy providers generate or procure energy, while utilities distribute and manage their delivery to consumers, ensuring a reliable supply of essential resources like electricity, natural gas, or water. The incorporation of edge computing technologies provides a comprehensive solution to challenges faced by utilities and energy producers. It provides <strong>real-time insights</strong>, supports adaptability to <strong>renewable energy transitions</strong>, <strong>optimizes distribution networks</strong>, enhances <strong>building energy efficiency</strong>, and efficiently manages <strong>EV charging infrastructure</strong>.</p>

<p>In the utilities and energy production domain, the adoption of edge computing addresses a spectrum of crucial needs. Firstly, it enables real-time monitoring of energy output and production processes, providing enhanced visibility and control over operations. This becomes particularly significant in the context of renewable energy sources, which often exhibit intermittent generation patterns.</p>

<p>As the energy industry undergoes a pivotal shift from fossil fuels to renewables, edge computing plays a central role in supporting this transition. It facilitates the intelligent adaptation and repurposing of machinery, fostering collaboration with machine makers to enhance the intelligence of industrial equipment. For example, gas generators can be switched to hydrogen, and edge computing can support machine makers to turn their machineries into adaptable and intelligent solutions. Edge computing can make the transformation smoother and facilitates the repurposing of existing infrastructure. 
Optimizing the distribution of energy through power grids is another critical aspect where edge computing proves to be invaluable. Improved instrumentation of the grid enables better balance, availability, and reliability. Notable use cases underscore the need for highly accurate real-time monitoring at high-power and medium exchange points, facilitating both immediate system insights and the creation of historical data for comprehensive analysis.</p>

<p>Furthermore, edge computing offers tailored solutions for monitoring and optimizing the energy efficiency of buildings. Given that a significant portion of CO2 emissions (<a href="https://www.iea.org/energy-system/buildings">30%</a>) arise from buildings, real-time monitoring, data analytics and AI at the edge can play a pivotal role in reducing environmental impact.</p>

<p>Additionally, the integration of edge computing transforms Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations into strategic points of energy distribution for utility providers. This ensures the efficient management of energy resources, aligning the charging infrastructure with the broader energy distribution strategy.</p>

<h3 id="energy-grid-operators">Energy Grid Operators:</h3>
<p>Energy grid operators have a critical need for real-time and comprehensive monitoring of the entire distribution grid to ensure the efficiency and reliability of power supply. The deployment of sensors and smart devices at various points in the grid is made possible through edge computing, enabling continuous data collection and analysis at the source. By processing data at the edge, operators can gain instant insights into grid conditions, detect anomalies, and respond swiftly to potential issues, ultimately enhancing overall grid resilience.</p>

<p>Another significant challenge for energy grid operators is managing the intermittency of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power. These sources introduce fluctuations in power production, leading to dynamic energy flows. Edge computing addresses this challenge by offering a proactive solution for managing these fluctuations through localized decision-making near the energy sources. In situations of excess power on the grid, edge devices can autonomously trigger the switching off of specific renewable sources, preventing overloads and grid instability. Conversely, when excess power can be stored in alternative forms, edge computing provides the intelligence to initiate the storage process efficiently.</p>

<h3 id="point-of-consumption-management">Point of Consumption Management:</h3>
<p>Point of Consumption Managers frequently face the challenge of monitoring and understanding the users’ consumption patterns. Edge computing proves to be instrumental in addressing this concern by facilitating <strong>real-time analysis of data at the edge of the network</strong>, in close proximity to the data source, using AI when appropriate. This localized processing allows for swift analysis of substantial volumes of user data without the necessity to transmit it to a centralized cloud server. The result is an expedited understanding of users’ behaviors, preferences, and trends. The capability to gain immediate insights empowers managers to make informed decisions promptly and adjust strategies in response to the evolving consumption patterns.</p>

<p>Edge computing also brings an important advantage when implementing measures to effectively influence users’ habits. By conducting data processing locally at the edge, managers can implement personalized and timely interventions aimed at encouraging specific behaviors. For instance, the calculation and communication of discounts for delayed consumption can be dynamically executed in real-time, aligning with users’ current consumption patterns. The low latency and responsiveness inherent in edge computing ensure that users receive targeted incentives or messages precisely when they are most likely to impact decision-making. This proactive approach enhances managers’ capacity to shape user habits in alignment with their business objectives.</p>

<h3 id="sovereignty-in-domestic-production">Sovereignty in Domestic Production:</h3>
<p>Energy security is a strategic objective of many countries, with the aim of avoiding excessive reliance on external markets for power procurement. Countries, entities, and even individuals can have the capacity to make their own decisions regarding consumption and distribution of energy. This is where edge computing plays an impactful role. By leveraging edge computing technologies, it is possible to strategically manage energy consumption patterns, thereby reducing the need to purchase additional power from external markets during peak periods, giving more independence to the private or public users and producers.</p>

<p>Additionally, by employing edge computing to smooth out power consumption peaks, countries enhance their energy self-sufficiency and reduce susceptibility to market fluctuations. This not only contributes to greater economic stability but also aligns with the broader goal of fostering national autonomy in managing critical resources. The integration of edge computing technologies therefore becomes a strategic imperative for nations aiming to strengthen their sovereignty and safeguard against vulnerabilities associated with energy dependencies.</p>

<p>SixSq stands at the forefront of transforming the energy sector with a comprehensive array of solutions embedded within its Nuvla.io ecosystem. Out of the many apps that SixSq provides via <a href="/platform">Nuvla.io</a>, AI EdgeLabs, Parquery, Clearblade, Kadiska, Eximprod, and CLEMAP collectively offer a multifaceted approach to addressing key challenges in the industry. Through these applications and its <a href="/nuvlaedge">NuvlaEdge</a> software, SixSq provides invaluable tools for monitoring production and consumption, capturing crucial metrics such as voltage, current, phase, and much more. The platform’s capability to create a robust data warehouse facilitates the storage of historical data, laying the foundation for <strong>AI training</strong> and <strong>predictive analytics</strong>.</p>

<p>One of the <a href="/blog/discover/2022/05/03/4-ways-to-know-if-you-need-edge-computing.html">advantages of edge computing</a> is that you can collect, process and store data near its source, in factories, shops, warehouses, energy plants, in fact anywhere you need a better understanding of what is going on in your business or organisation. As is the nature of such locations, this often requires the use of small, portable and low energy devices.  As is the nature of business, we constantly expect better, faster and easier to use edge intelligence, including AI algorithms running at the edge, improved resource consumption and so on.</p>

<p>In these situations, hardware becomes the limiting factor. Small devices cannot host the increasingly resource-demanding applications required by business, so we have to look for clever software solutions.  For that reason, SixSq’s <a href="/nuvlaedge">NuvlaEdge</a> software has been container-ready and Docker-friendly since the outset. Responding to the requirements of a wide range of customers, from fields as diverse as humanitarian work, smart cities, open science and earth observation, the SixSq team is pleased to announce that NuvlaEdges can now also be deployed via the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> “family”. Kubernetes brings <strong>more functionality and security</strong>, improved load balancing and resilience. Applications that are defined via Kubernetes manifest files can be deployed to NuvlaEdges. All the features and flexibility of Kubernetes are utilised behind the Nuvla.io interface, making it easier for you to deploy.</p>

<p>Now we’ll dive into the details of how you can leverage this improved deployment feature. ⬇️</p>

<h2 id="installation-requirements">Installation requirements</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.nuvla.io/nuvlaedge/installation/requirements/#prerequisites-when-running-on-k8s-distribution">prerequisite</a> is for a Kubernetes flavour and <a href="https://helm.sh">Helm</a> to be installed.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="https://k3s.io/">k3s</a> distribution is preferred distribution when considering memory footprint and ease of installation and configuration.</li>
  <li>Helm is used for deploying the NuvlaEdge containers.</li>
  <li>The documentation can be found <a href="https://docs.nuvla.io/nuvlaedge/installation/install-with-helm/">here</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="footprint">Footprint</h3>

<p>As NuvlaEdge is designed to be run in devices at the computing edge (giveaway is in the name), the resource footprint of the
underlying Container Orchestration Engine (COE) is an important consideration.
In this case we look for a full-feature Kubernetes installation.
Another consideration is the ease of installation of the COE.
Given the requirements for memory, features and installation the <a href="https://k3s.io/">k3s</a> distribution is preferred.</p>

<p>The table below follows the methodology as outlined <a href="https://www.portainer.io/blog/comparing-k0s-k3s-microk8s">here</a></p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/blog/kubernetes_coe_footprint.png" alt="image info" title="a title" /></p>

<p>As can be seen in the table, the memory footprints are very similar between the COEs.
In fact, the the total memory footprint of k3s is slightly larger than the base k8s COE.
The main factor in selecting the <a href="https://k3s.io/">k3s</a> distribution as the recommended COE for NuvlaEdge 
is the extremely easy one-line deployment and subsequent configuration steps.</p>

<h2 id="application-deployment">Application deployment</h2>

<p>In a manner similar to the Docker NuvlaEdge case, applications can be deployed to Kubernetes NuvlaEdges.
The base requirement is that the application is defined by a Kubernetes YAML manifest.
The manifest may contain multiple Kubernetes “Kinds” e.g. Deployments, Jobs, Services etc.
When an application is deployed in this fashion, the management and life-cycle on the NuvlaEdge
node is managed by the Kubernetes COE.
All the functionality of a NuvlaEdge, as in the Docker case, is available e.g.
update; clone; shutdown/restart; access to log files.</p>

<p>The issues of energy provision and management have been at the forefront of discussions both in domestic and business settings over the last couple of years. Conflicts that impact supply coupled with increasing concern about our rapidly warming planet have made us all much more aware of how we use and source our energy. It seems, therefore, like a great idea to switch to <strong>renewable, decentralized energy</strong> sources, doesn’t it? But have you thought about how these energy supplies will be managed? The complex distribution system that ensures the lights go on when we flick the switch has been in place for decades and we need to turn it all on its head to make sure renewably-sourced energy hits our households and businesses with the same efficiency.</p>

<p>Traditional power grids date back to when Thomas Edison was a young man and are designed to supply electricity at constant voltages, driven by fossil fuel supplies.  We have had a long time to perfect the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in this way, but now solar, wind and other renewable energy sources with their decentralized production are shaking up the model. Unless you live in the Truman Show, wind and sunlight are much more difficult to predict, which means forecasting and managing supply and demand is more challenging. On top of that, people are not only consuming electricity in different ways, with, for example, the increased usage of electric vehicles, but also potentially putting energy back into the grid via solar panels. All of this can affect the stability of power grids and mess with the way stakeholders in the system are funded. So <strong>how can we transition to cleaner energy while still ensuring that the grid infrastructure is stable, properly maintained and funded?</strong></p>

<p>Many elements are required to make this work, including updates to policy and regulatory frameworks, public awareness campaigns, consumer incentives and of course cutting-edge technologies. All stakeholders in the energy market will have to embrace innovative solutions to deliver the dynamic market needed to address these challenges. Decentralized microgrids, where a group of interconnected buildings form their own local energy system, will certainly play a part. Efficient microgrids will rely heavily on the latest technologies such as the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence and cloud and edge computing. Moreover , the liberalization of the electrical energy market will certainly lead to the emergence of new digital services in the energy sector. These services will mainly rely on the electrical energy consumption/production forecast. And here is where <strong>SWARM</strong> comes in.</p>

<p>The members of the SWARM consortium are focusing on the technological challenges of the above problem. The project is building a digital platform based on a “Smart Energy Management Appliance” (SEMA) which can be deployed on microgrid infrastructures. The plan is to provide new services which will allow users to become active participants, thus becoming direct beneficiaries of a liberalized energy market. The SEMA will provide not only supply and usage predictions, but also the ability to trade energy and flexibility. The project is supported by experts in the fields of energy and digitalization.</p>
