        "content": "<p>For some time, analysts and industry experts have been heralding <a href=\"/blog/discover/2019/11/08/what-is-edge-computing.html\">edge computing</a> as the next big thing that will revolutionise the IT and telecom industries. But for industries to move, there needs to be real and meaningful benefits, achievable within reasonable investment and at an acceptable risk.  It would indeed therefore be great to identify the ‘killer app’ for edge computing – a single heroic app to unlock the full potential of this promising distributed computing paradigm, one that’s capable of fulfilling the level of world domination predicted by analysts. So where is it?</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps this is the wrong question. If we stand back, the edge is not there to run a single all-encompassing, killer app, but to enable an ecosystem of applications that allows organisations to better extract value from data near its source. And this objective is neither simple nor standard, since, like us humans, every business is different, with different goals, constraints and assets. However, edge computing will not succeed if all its implementations are bespoke. The good news is that there is an existing ecosystem that exhibits a similar need for wide and wild variety, yet is based on standardised building blocks that tech companies can provide at affordable pricing, thanks to economy of scale.</p>\n\n<p>Where is this ecosystem? I suggest looking in your pocket. The dominance of the smartphone appliance is no longer questioned today… yet what about all those apps? Your mobile device is not satisfied with a one-size-fits-all killer app, so why should your edge infrastructure be any different?</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"learning-from-the-apple-app-store\">Learning from the Apple® App Store</h3>\n\n<p>Apparently, even the mighty Steve Jobs didn’t initially foresee the rise of the App Store as a key part of the iPhone®’s success story, instead expecting web apps to be the next big thing. Apple® had to move quickly to meet developer demands, opening up the iPhone® ecosystem to allow these people to create native iOS apps and this, in turn, led to the creation of the App Store to monetise these apps and make them available to customers.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-first-marketplace-for-edge-apps\">The first marketplace for edge apps</h3>\n\n<p>For edge computing to work well, businesses need a simple and scalable way to purchase apps and immediately deploy them where their data is. But of course no-one needs integration complexity, complicated contractual negotiations and operational risk.</p>\n\n<p>Here at SixSq we’re now on a similar path to Apple®, building the world’s first repository of edge apps, the Nuvla Marketplace, usefully informed by the experiences of the App Store, Google Play® and other digital distribution platforms.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"app-vendors\">App vendors</h3>\n\n<p>Since June 2022, we’ve been fostering strong relationships with some of the best creative minds in edge computing app development through the SixSq App Vendor Programme. These specialists don’t pull any punches – their powerful apps are oriented to omnipresent AI, steely <a href=\"https://sixsq.com/news/2022/06/13/news-aiedgelabs.html\">cyber defence</a>, operational optimisation and predictive analytics to meet business challenges head on. I’m talking about reducing latency, overcoming bandwidth challenges, increasing autonomy, ensuring data sovereignty, cutting the carbon footprint and more.</p>\n\n<p>To de-risk projects and ensure future-proofed solutions, we’re all about standardised operational, technical and contractual app development within a systematic framework for an open, frictionless ecosystem.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-source-of-killer-apps-for-the-edge\">The source of killer apps for the edge</h3>\n\n<p>Together this makes the <a href=\"/marketplace\">Nuvla Marketplace</a> the go-to source of business-ready apps, provided and maintained by domain experts. If you like a dubious metaphor, we at SixSq provide the Tinder app for edge computing and, as the platform operator, we also come on your date as chaperone!</p>\n\n<p>With our approach, vendors can register new apps on the Nuvla Marketplace in a few hours, while you can deploy these apps in seconds and enable your edge devices in minutes. The potential for our edge marketplace to deliver multiple killer apps is real. Of course time will tell, but the telling is already starting. Don’t wait for the killer app, the marketplace delivers a suite of readily-available apps to deliver your business outcomes.</p>\n"

This <a href=\"https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe_en\">Horizon Europe</a> project has the ambition of delivering a Meta-Operating System within 3 years, bridging IoT devices to the cloud through <a href=\"https://sixsq.com/blog/discover/2019/11/08/what-is-edge-computing.html\">edge computing</a> devices.</p>\n\n<p>ICOS, code name for ‘IoT2Cloud Operating System’, is a unique computing system supporting the interconnection of IoT, edge and cloud resources.</p>\n\n<p>The concept of a continuum between IoT, edge and cloud aims to tackle the challenges linked to the ever-growing sector of computing and sensing devices, and to the increasing demand for data-intensive applications, especially at the edge and in the cloud.</p>\n\n<p>By enabling this continuum, in a way which is both technology and device-agnostic, ICOS will facilitate data generation, transfer, and processing - thanks to AI.</p>\n\n<p>ICOS System architecture, functional requirements and use cases were at the heart of the discussions during this 2-day meeting. Indeed, ICOS will address real-life challenges in various fields, with a positive impact on reliability and sustainability.</p>\n\n<p>4 relevant <a href=\"https://www.icos-project.eu/use-cases\">use cases</a> were brought by project partners:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Bring precision agriculture to the next step by embarking ICOS into agricultural robots, or agrobots, in the fields. Thanks to AI modules, the robots will be able to detect a disease among a plantation, calculate the real amount of fertiliser needed by each plant, etc.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Improve railway maintenance thanks to a combination of IoT sensors and edge devices, enabling real-time monitoring of the infrastructure metrics and optimising decision-making process.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Enhance “in-car” user experience thanks to immersive content display linked to touristic trips, and shared media streaming.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Optimise household energy consumption thanks to an autonomous system based on continuum management.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Fruitful interactions took place during the “ICOS match” workshop between technologies and user stories. The SixSq team was glad to see that <a href=\"/platform\">Nuvla</a>/<a href=\"https://sixsq.com/nuvlaedge\">NuvlaEdge</a> had a lot of matches and will bring value to all of the use cases in the project by facilitating management of IoT devices and applications.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to this working group, all Consortium members (technology and use cases providers) had a chance to draw a mental map of the combination of technologies needed to perform each use case.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, these two days were a great opportunity for partners to meet in-person, but also to taste Catalan gastronomy – especially tapas!</p>\n\n<p>Next step from our side: start working on the component that will be used to manage edge devices, and data flow through the IoT to cloud continuum. We are looking forward to bringing further updates during the life of the project.</p>\n"

        "content": "<p>Thanks to guest author <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/innaushakova/\">Inna Ushakova</a> for sharing her valuable insights into the state of cyber security in the manufacturing industry.</p>\n\n<p>Now more than ever, cybersecurity is extremely relevant for the manufacturing industry. IBM’s X-Force Threat Intelligence Index 2022 report found that manufacturing is the most attacked industry as of 2021, receiving the brunt of 23.2% of the attacks and reaching a global average of <strong>$4.24M in data breach costs</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>The manufacturing industry lacks cybersecurity maturity, a fact that criminals exploit relentlessly. This is evidenced by the high-stakes burdens placed on supply chains wreaking havoc on the manufacturing industry, which is still recovering from losses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>Instrumental to the wellbeing and healthy performance of any manufacturing company, operational technology (OT) supports core-business operations and its safety is essential to ensure sustainable growth and effective means of innovation. For that to happen, cybersecurity needs to be a key, foundational element of any company’s core strategy. High, rigorous security standards and protocols in data, software, and infrastructure coupled with AI-powered solutions allows for process agility and transparency.</p>\n\n<p>Below,  we detail one of the most high-profile cybersecurity attacks of recent years to illustrate how severe and crucial it is for manufacturing companies to take their security environment seriously.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"manufacturing-under-threat\">Manufacturing under threat</h3>\n\n<p>The manufacturing industry is victim to ransomware, server access, BEC and data theft, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, credential harvesting, and more.</p>\n\n<p>Next, let’s see a high profile case of an attack in action. As the result of a devastating cyberattack involving the LockerGoga ransomware, Norsk Hydro, a multinational aluminum manufacturer with operations in 40 countries, closed many of its plants and was forced to move others offline. The attack compromised the firm’s IT systems across multiple business functions, including the company’s smelting plants in Norway, Qatar, and Brazil. The total cost is estimated at <strong>$75 million</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>As exemplified by the Norsk Hydro case, cybersecurity experts assert that cyber criminals are using more ruthless methods to achieve their objectives and the proficiency of attacks is expected to advance as they continue to develop new methods for cyber attacks. For all industries with OT networks ransomware again led the charge for attack types, accounting for 36% of all attacks and echoing the overall attack trend across all industries. While the IT networks were compromised in the vast majority of these attacks, the impact carried over to victims’ operational technology in many of these instances.</p>\n\n<p>Looking at the variety of attacks and the latest cyber criminal developments, the manufacturing industry remains a high-interest target for cybercriminals looking to deploy well-crafted attacks. Cyber attacks are relatively easy for criminals to conduct and are hard to protect against using traditional security technologies.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-can-an-ai-powered-solution-advance-your-edgeiot-cyber-security\">How can an AI-powered solution advance your Edge/IoT cyber security?</h2>\n\n<p>Cyber security is more important than ever before, as the attack surface area has increased due to the latest wave of digital transformation that is enhancing business agility and developing new customer experiences. When it comes to the security of Edge and IoT infrastructures, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and deep reinforcement learning are unmatched.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://edgelabs.ai/platform/\">AI EdgeLabs platform</a> is embedded with a proprietary network telemetry and monitoring sensor that protects every layer of an Edge and IoT architecture. The AI-powered solution delivers smart means to detect anomalies that signal the presence of threats, threat intelligence software with powerful analytics tools for robust traffic inspection, and swift incident response and remediation.</p>\n\n<p>During its deployment on-premises (on the factory side), the AI EdgeLabs Sensor runs a configurable set of security checks and topology research to collect the initial context of your environment. Data collected from the sensor is analyzed by the AI EdgeLabs platform that provides a set of AI-based models that are pre-trained on the existing knowledge base of threat patterns and attack signatures.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/blog/Manufacturing scheme.png\" alt=\"AI EdgeLabs platform\" style=\"max-width: 100%\" /></p>\n\n<p>Looking at the graph above, we can see the SCADA power system. The electrical distribution system consists of controllers, sensors, and operator-interface points.</p>\n\n<p>For real-time monitoring and controlling of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), the system uses circuit breakers and power monitors. Data is transmitted from PLCs and other devices to a computer-based SCADA node located on each sub-station.</p>\n\n<p>One or more computers can be located on different points. The AI EdgeLabs Sensor can be implemented on each computer-based SCADA node to protect the whole system. This includes factory machines, HMIs, sensors, and end devices, protecting them from malfunctioning, data modifying, injection attacks such as SQL injection and other forms of advanced malware.</p>\n\n<p>The EdgeLabs Sensor helps:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Generate near-realtime visibility of infrastructure and application performance;</li>\n  <li>Prevent and block threat sources in real-time;</li>\n  <li>Integrate cloud-based and on-premises application performance monitoring;</li>\n  <li>Monitor SaaS applications from your users’ vantage point;</li>\n  <li>Monitor IaaS resources from your users’ vantage point.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The AI EdgeLabs platform equips your security teams with multi-layered threat intelligence software, advanced network visibility, and automated remediation to protect every asset, device, server, or network element of your manufacturing environment.</p>\n\n<p>With AI EdgeLabs available in the <a href=\"https://sixsq.com/marketplace\">Nuvla Marketplace</a>, companies now have an easier way to cyber protect their edge assets. Indeed all edge devices, servers and virtual machines running the NuvleEdge software can now be protected using the AI EdgeLabs software, providing a 1-click cyber protection to all sectors of the economy concerned by edge computing.

There’s an important lesson here for organisations collecting data, video and audio — these inputs are your cards and absolutely no one else should see them.</p>\n\n<p>The wealth of information from your sensors, cameras, microphones, actuators and other new digital sources should yield valuable insights without intrusion.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"privacy-intrusion-is-a-hot-topic\">Privacy intrusion is a hot topic</h3>\n\n<p>When talking with customers, partners and prospects, I’m surprised by how frequently the topic of privacy intrusion comes up, and this is usually part of a broader conversation around the importance of data sovereignty. In Europe, these discussions typically reference the data privacy and security law, the <a href=\"https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/?cn-reloaded=1\">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR), while in the Americas and further afield, other reference points are used to understand and interpret the laws around digital privacy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What can you see?</strong></p>\n\n<p>As the cost of easy-to-deploy digital source equipment is going down, technical capabilities are going up, so you can understand, see and hear much more from your input streams than ever before. For example, today’s latest video cameras deliver extremely high levels of definition. This is great for generating precise insights on, say, product quality or behavioural analysis – information that’s very valuable to your organisation and to others.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"why-keep-this-information-close\">Why keep this information close?</h3>\n\n<p>No-one else should be able to see your information, or that of your customers. There are onerous standards and regulations around the operation and management of surveillance equipment, including closed-circuit television (CCTV). These requirements represent such a burden with which most organisations are unwilling or unable to comply. But without adequate protection of the information you gather, there is a very real and growing risk of someone snooping on you.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-to-avoid-prying-eyes\">How to avoid prying eyes?</h3>\n\n<p>A key promise of <a href=\"/blog/discover/2019/11/08/what-is-edge-computing\">edge computing</a> is that instead of sending your data, video and audio to the cloud to be processed, you keep it close. All of your input streams are processed locally, near the digital device that generates them. Here’s what you gain:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Higher-quality insights: When streams are processed in their entirety near to source, they yield the best possible results. But when streams are transported over the network to the cloud for processing, their quality is normally reduced and this can result in degraded insights.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Speedier insights: Your time to insight is faster if you process streams locally – this can be done in real time and without any delays or round trips. Instead, sending streams over the network can cause perturbations and delays, especially if connections are weak and bandwidth is limited. Also as video and audio definition increases, data size increases and journeys to the cloud take longer.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Easy data fusion: Because your data is available at the edge, analysis can be easily performed here on all different categories of data (video, audio, etc). An example is analysis both of the sound of a noisy vehicle and images as the vehicle passes, showing its brand, model and number plate. Data fusion such as this enables more powerful analytics – in this case, it could mean better predictive maintenance or regulation enforcement.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Tighter privacy: The excellent news is that all the above are achieved without privacy intrusion. Why would you want to move, process and store privacy-sensitive data in the cloud – which, by the way, additionally requires designing and managing a whole layer of cloud privacy applications? Instead with edge computing the same information stays local and is stripped from any data that might intrude on citizen or corporate privacy.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Better control: With edge computing, you call the shots. A <a href=\"https://nuvla.io/\">well-managed edge computing solution</a> puts you in remote control, able to update the devices and apps running at the edge, aligned with your changing needs. So as your organisation evolves, so too can your edge computing strategy.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"want-to-see-more-from-us\">Want to see more from us?</h3>\n\n<p>At SixSq, we have a wealth of experience in privacy protection.

        "content": "<h4 id=\"considering-an-edge-solution-read-on-for-tips-and-potential-pitfalls\">Considering an edge solution? Read on for tips and potential pitfalls.</h4>\n\n<p>A pilot entering cloudy, turbulent skies is effectively flying blind. It’s a critical situation. Every moment that ticks by without clear visibility means things can change and danger levels increase. It may become impossible to reach the destination airport. Data is needed immediately – facts about the aircraft, its status, position, nearby hazards, and weather conditions – so the pilot is able to proceed without guesswork and regain full control.</p>\n\n<p>As a private pilot, I know a lot about airplanes but I’d never trust myself to build one and take to the skies! A do-it-yourself (DIY) solution – even one made from excellent parts – carries too much risk. I feel the same is true for edge computing.</p>\n\n<p>Too many times, I’ve seen DIY edge solutions fail. Companies realise too late the downsides of unbudgeted cost, protracted time to readiness and operational complexity. And they clip their own wings by sacrificing system reliability and evolvability.</p>\n\n<p>I guess people are tempted to self-build because edge computing seems similar to cloud computing. Sure, they share several attributes but they’re also very different.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/blog/airplanes.png\" alt=\"airplanes\" /></p>\n\n<p class=\"caption\">Through my aeroclub, I’m not limited to flying just one type of aircraft. I like to keep my options open.</p>\n\n<p>Take, for example, the physical environment. Cloud computing happens in highly controlled locations with easy-to-access servers. But the edge is challenged by temperature and humidity changes, dust and vibration. Unregulated settings get power and network jitters, have more cyber-security risk and can be complex to access.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of a DIY edge solution, some organisations ask a vertical solution provider to solve a specific use case. The danger here is a significant investment with little flexibility in the future. As business needs evolve, the original solution may not adapt. A flexibility promise might be made but it will be on the provider’s terms, with limited powers of negotiation.</p>\n\n<p>An obvious alternative is a cloud-first approach. Start with a cloud from one of the hyperscalers (Amazon, Microsoft Azure or Google) or a private cloud, and deploy at the edge as mandated. <strong>Warning!</strong> There is a conflict of interest. While you seek the best possible edge outcomes, these providers are in the business of selling compute and storage. They want you to pump as much data as possible to the cloud. So you’ll miss what’s arguably the <a href=\"/blog/discover/2022/01/28/why-fly-blind-free-your-business-critical-data-from-the-cloud\">No.1 benefit of edge computing</a>: processing raw data near its source.</p>\n\n<p>Cloud-first can work for simple deployments but – once again – you risk clipping your own wings. As your business needs grow in scale and sophistication (trust me, they will), a cloud approach quickly limits your ability to expand. At which point, you may regret putting all your eggs in the same cloud basket.</p>\n\n<p>So the optimal approach is edge-first and cloud-neutral. This aims to privilege the edge (instead of the cloud) because this is where you act on your data. An edge-first solution does not limit your ability to process, transform, aggregate and anonymise the data. On the contrary, it generally empowers developers with a wide range of tools (including machine learning) to take full advantage of the data produced at the edge and act on it. And you do all this on your own terms while also leveraging the unlimited processing power and storage of the cloud. You get the best of both worlds – edge and cloud.</p>\n\n<p>Another way to keep your options open, ensuring the most future-proof edge experience, is to select a provider offering <a href=\"https://nuvla.io\">OPEX</a> over CAPEX. Added to this, edge-first providers are likely to help you deploy a shared infrastructure strategy. This allows several old and new apps from different sources to run alongside each other at the edge, which is likely to generate a very attractive return on investment.</p>\n\n<p>One final thought. <strong>Data sovereignty</strong> matters. Keeping tight control of where your data gets processed is strategic for many organisations. A key decision is which parts of your data will be processed at the edge and which in the cloud. The solution you select must give you the right level of control over your data flows.</p>\n\n<p>An edge-first, cloud-neutral approach means you won’t clip your own wings. We will be happy to help you on your journey to the edge. So please get in touch for lock-in free, future-proofed advice.</p>\n"

        "content": "<h4 id=\"create-a-future-proof-solution-for-your-smart-city-by-implementing-a-shared-infrastructure\">Create a future-proof solution for your smart city by implementing a shared infrastructure</h4>\n\n<p>You can find many, many smart cities that share a common architecture. They have one or many sensors producing data. And this data needs to be processed in real time to provide insights, either to take action or to predict trends.</p>\n\n<p>Let me introduce you to the fascinating work we’re doing in the Swiss city of Geneva, partnering with <a href=\"https://securaxis.com/\">Securaxis</a>, who provide sound analytics for smart cities, <a href=\"https://www.hesge.ch/hepia/\">HEPIA</a>, Geneva’s university of landscape, engineering and architecture, and HEG, the city’s school of business administration. In the context of the <a href=\"https://www.hesge.ch/hepia/recherche-developpement/projets-recherche/en-cours/medina\">MEDInA</a> project, we’re using the Securaxis SONAL machine learning app to measure sound so we can monitor and categorise traffic. We’re also using cameras and more machine learning from <a href=\"https://www.hesge.ch/heg/\">HEG</a> to understand traffic lanes. Combined, this provides valuable real-time insights into traffic flow and helps to control street lighting to provide safer streets while saving energy.</p>\n\n<p>Another example comes from the gorgeous Italian <a href=\"https://www.cittametropolitana.fi.it/\">City of Florence</a> where, in the context of the <a href=\"https://elastic-project.eu/\">ELASTIC</a> project, with partners such as <a href=\"https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/transport\">Thales</a> providing smart sensors for transportation, <a href=\"https://www.bsc.es/\">Barcelona Supercomputing Center</a>, <a href=\"https://informationcatalyst.com/\">ICE</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ikerlan.es/en/\">Ikerlan</a>, we are providing a range of new services on the city’s tram network. One of these services is predictive maintenance – we use laser scanners on the rails to monitor rail profile degradation to predict the need for maintenance operations. Another is synchronisation of traffic intersections to favour public transport traffic while minimising impact on all other traffic. And a third is providing proactive driver assistance with real-time emergency alerts in case of intrusion onto the tram path.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"but-what-are-the-really-smart-cities-doing\">But what are the really smart cities doing?</h2>\n\n<p>The really smart cities do more than share a common architecture. The also share edge infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>Their IT architectural anatomy includes:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Sensors</li>\n  <li>Processing unit (an edge device)</li>\n  <li>Communication (to enable edge-to-cloud and/or edge-to-edge)</li>\n  <li>Cloud (to aggregate information)</li>\n  <li>And of course apps or algorithms (to process data and take actions)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It is extremely wasteful to replicate this architecture for each and every use case – all the applications mentioned above plus many more, such as measuring air quality and monitoring temperature and sound pollution.</p>\n\n<p>Think of the energy consumed in manufacturing all this redundant hardware… and the energy needed to power it. And what if new use cases come along that require mixing or fusing different data (say, audio and video to identify the source of traffic accidents or noisy or polluting vehicles)? If everything is built in silos, interoperability is much harder, and with independent systems there can be no cost sharing and only limited economies of scale to improve the ROI.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sharing-edge-infrastructure-to-take-actions-in-real-time\">Sharing edge infrastructure to take actions in real time</h2>\n<p>Instead, what makes much more sense is to use a shared edge infrastructure. This means that sensors are connected to a multi-tenant edge computing unit, able to host several apps or algorithms, connected to a range of sensors. It also means the unit can create many insights which enable the city to take actions in real time.</p>\n\n<p>Further, once smart city operators are able to remotely control this architecture it becomes much more future proof. Updates, upgrades and even new use cases can be deployed with minimal, if any, intrusion into the smart city physical infrastructure.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"intelligent-infrastructure--common-sense\">Intelligent Infrastructure = common sense</h2>\n<p>In North America, people are starting to describe this type of shared edge infrastructure for smart cities as ‘Intelligent Infrastructure’. I call it common sense, since cities must evolve quickly to provide citizens with the level of services they require.</p>\n\n<p>The climate emergency is also accelerating the need for such architecture, since public transport systems must become more inclusive, delivering a greater sense of security along with higher performance. Understanding the impact of inescapable rising temperatures is also essential and, for this, situational awareness and behaviour trend analysis are key. As discussed in previous blogs, only edge computing is capable of doing all this while also protecting citizen privacy.</p>\n\n<p>We at SixSq have the technology and a growing ecosystem to address these challenges. Get in touch if you want to better understand what benefits a shared edge infrastructure can bring to your community. .</p>\n\n"

Enterprise infrastructure is evolving with more cloud, more devices and more data processing requirements at the edge. It’s inevitable that the global market will see massive growth – there are strong indications of more than 5x expansion over the next 5 years.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-edge-computing\">What is edge computing?</h2>\n\n<p>This method of computing brings computation closer to where it’s needed. Instead of sending raw data to the cloud or a data centre for processing, edge computing provides data processing power at the edge of a network – in other words, near where the data is produced and collected. The act of processing data at the edge is sometimes referred to as near-data processing.</p>\n\n<p>Edge computing is a response to the explosion of data produced by “things” in Internet of Things (IoT) applications, as well as sensors, still and high-definition video cameras, actuators and other new digital sources.</p>\n\n<p>Edge computing is not merely the provision of a standard gateway. It delivers intelligence in the form of specialist hardware and software: edge hardware, sensors and actuators, one or more apps, and a <a href=\"https://nuvla.io\">management platform</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"who-needs-it\">Who needs it?</h2>\n\n<p>There are four great questions to reveal whether your organisation needs edge computing:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Does my company need to act in near-real time on data generated by sensors?</li>\n  <li>Do we generate data that’s too big to transfer economically and sensibly to the cloud?</li>\n  <li>Is the internet link between the digital sources and the cloud unreliable or jittery?</li>\n  <li>Does my company have a privacy or security issue when transferring or processing data in the public/private cloud</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If you answered yes to one or more of these, there’s a good chance your company needs edge computing.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"who-is-using-it-already\">Who is using it already?</h2>\n\n<p>Organisations in every sector are already using or thinking about using edge computing. The list really is endless, but here are some easily recognised applications:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"/case-studies/retail\">Retail stores</a></li>\n  <li>Factory floors</li>\n  <li>Smart cities – air quality, traffic monitoring, dynamic lighting</li>\n  <li>Cruise ship management</li>\n  <li>Robotics applications</li>\n  <li>IoT applications</li>\n  <li>Big data science applications</li>\n  <li>Outpost deployments</li>\n  <li>Field offices</li>\n  <li>Emergency relief infrastructures</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"can-we-help\">Can we help?</h2>\n\n<p>At SixSq, we have experience with these and many other use cases. So please get in touch if you’d like help in assessing the potential benefits of edge computing for your organisation.</p>\n\n<p>We are strong proponents of open source and open systems for edge computing. This means you can count on our honest advice.</p>\n"

It’s helpful to know what’s running under the hood.</h4>\n\n<p>Private pilots like me are trained to always take a careful look under the airplane engine cowling prior to lift-off.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, everyone embarking on an edge computing journey should know about the powerhouse. In an ideal world, you’ll select a managed edge solution which frees you to focus on your business instead of the underlying IT bits and pieces. But it’s helpful to know what’s running your edge computing.</p>\n\n<p>The parts required for excellent edge computing are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Edge hardware for running applications at the edge (unless this hardware is embedded in a single sensor, which probably means significant lock-in and constraints on how your solution will be able to evolve).</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Sensors and actuators – these are your “things” in the Internet of Things.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>One or more apps to process the data produced by your things, extract insights, generate real-time events and act locally if needed.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>A <a href=\"https://nuvla.io/\">management platform</a> to ensure your fleet of edge devices is online and doing what it is supposed to do. This will also allow you to deploy, update and upgrade the apps deployed at the edge. It’s rapidly becoming the norm to use third-party apps (e.g. machine learning), so the management platform must be sufficiently open to host these apps. It should also be capable of evolving and, even better, hosting your own apps and those from a range of vendors and app developer partners.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And remember that you don’t have to buy and install software yourself anymore, since a managed service – also referred to as software-as-a-service (SaaS) – is now available, taking away much of the pain and risk for you. There are of course security and data sovereignty issues to consider, and I will cover these topics in a future article.</p>\n\n<p>With all the right elements, you can have what everyone wants – an edge solution that’s lock-in free and future proofed. But don’t be led into believing it’s easy to pull together those disparate parts and come up with the perfect do-it-yourself (DIY) solution. Find out about potential pitfalls by reading another of my blogs: Taking off with edge computing?

Edge computing provides the solution.</h4>\n\n<p>A pilot entering cloudy, turbulent skies is effectively flying blind. It’s a critical situation. Every moment that ticks by without clear visibility means things can change and danger levels increase. It may become impossible to reach the destination airport. Data is needed immediately – facts about the aircraft, its status, position, nearby hazards, and weather conditions – so the pilot is able to proceed without guesswork and regain full control.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/blog/meb-electric-plane.png\" alt=\"electric plane\" /></p>\n\n<p class=\"caption\">Flying is one of my passions and I’m loving this new fully electric single-engine airplane!</p>\n\n<p>Many companies today are also flying blind. Maybe yours is one of them? As you aim for a key business goal – perhaps a particular profit margin or an error-free target, or maybe an important KPI or complex decision – are you sometimes just feeling your way? It would be better to always know what’s happening in real time in the real world and therefore in your business.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Eliminate guesswork; regain control</strong></p>\n\n<p>To know what’s happening, your business needs to receive and analyse an “explosion of data” from an increasing number of digital sources outside the cloud and the data centre, including sensors, IoT devices, still and high-definition video cameras, and actuators. And this needs to be done in an ever-reducing window of time. If your competitors can do it faster, you’ll be in trouble.</p>\n\n<p>The solution is edge computing. Instead of shipping all your data to the cloud for processing, an edge computing IT infrastructure allows you to crunch it close to its source to extract insights and inform your organisation for more effective planning and execution. This doesn’t mean processing data on your PCs, laptops and tablets; it refers to new technology that you position in your field offices, retail stores or manufacturing floor, connected to your private, public, or hybrid cloud or your data centre.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>\"Edge computing is the IT infrastructure that lives outside the cloud or the data centre.\"\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Let’s look at a real-world example. Public transport companies are under pressure to stick to schedules, attract more commuters, and offer a more inclusive service. With edge computing, wheelchair users can be detected while waiting for their bus or train and an alert sent to the driver that this passenger may need extra help. Nice. This can be extended to an elderly person or a single parent with a toddler and stroller. The result is a safer ride for everyone and, by factoring in these events, the service remains on time.</p>\n\n<p>Surprisingly enough, most public transport companies have no way of knowing on a regular basis (never mind in near-real-time) how many people are using their vehicles, where they enter, and especially where they get off. This is a serious blind spot for planning and operations. And how about detecting that squeaking breaks are getting worn out and require maintenance?</p>\n\n<p>Processing raw data near its source is arguably the No.1 benefit of edge computing, since it allows you to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Detect events in near-real-time and therefore react very quickly</li>\n  <li>Greatly reduce the size of data you need to send to the cloud</li>\n  <li>Remove any intrusion into the privacy of users and citizens</li>\n  <li>Carry on working even if the network goes down for a moment</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you’d like to dive deeper into this, please see one of my other blogs – Making the case for edge computing. And in a future blog, I will demystify the key features to look for in an edge-to-cloud solution so you remain lock-in free and future proofed.</p>\n\n<p>The examples provided in this blog are already deployed by SixSq, an <a href=\"https://www.ekinops.com/\">Ekinops</a> company, using our <a href=\"https://nuvla.io/\">Nuvla</a> edge-to-cloud management platform.</p>\n\n<p>Today there’s no need to fly blind. Whether you’re about to embrace the cloud or you’re there already, now is a great time to add edge computing to your mix. For help with your journey to the edge, please get in touch.

With it, we have learned that the high demand for small, portable and low energy edge devices is very often incompatible with the resource-demanding nature of the target applications. But that’s not the only problem with today’s mindset towards Edge Computing.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"redefining-edge-management\">Redefining Edge Management</h3>\n\n<p>The NuvlaEdgee v2.0 software tackles today’s edge management limitations with innovative features.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/blog/blog_nbe2b.png\" alt=\"nuvlaedge 2.0\" /></p>\n\n<p>Here are the detailed new key features of the NuvlaEdge v2.0 software:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Clustering: from Nuvla, you can now instruct a NuvlaEdge powered device to join or leave another NuvlaEdge powered device, thus forming high-availability edge clusters, powered by Container Orchestration Engines</li>\n  <li>Networking: when in cluster mode, your NuvlaEdge powered devices will have an off-the-shelf routing mesh and internal DNS services, offered by the underlying Container Orchestration Engine (i.e. Docker Swarm)</li>\n  <li>High Availability: with NuvlaEdge clusters, if one NuvlaEdge device goes offline, whatever applications were running inside will automatically be moved to another suitable NuvlaEdge device within the cluster</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These features are built on top of an existing Container Orchestration Engine (i.e. Docker Swarm) in the edge device.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"smaller-faster-and-more-powerful\">Smaller, Faster and More Powerful</h3>\n\n<p>It’s not just about new features. All the old good NuvlaEdge v1 software perks are still there… in fact, most of them have been improved.</p>\n\n<p>For a faster and cleaner installation process, the NuvlaEdge v2 software was refactored with some of the old code merged into fewer components, thus optimising its total core size.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/blog/blog_nbec.png\" alt=\"nbe core size\" /></p>\n\n<p>Performance was also optimised, making the new NuvlaEdge v2 software the lightest one we have ever created.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/blog/blog_nbed.png\" alt=\"cpu\" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"easier-to-install-and-more-adaptable-to-infrastructure-changes\">Easier to Install, and More Adaptable to Infrastructure Changes</h3>\n\n<p>The NuvlaEdge v1 ssoftware required your edge device to be running in Docker Swarm mode. Well, that’s <strong>not the case anymore</strong> for NuvlaEdge v2. All you need is Docker Compose for the installation, and then the NuvlaEdge v2 ssoftware will adapt itself to the underlying host environment, whether that is a standalone Docker machine, or a Swarm cluster node.</p>\n\n<p>What’s not to like?

Adopting DevOps principles is therefore the natural way to go. In this blog, we explore how the Nuvla application management platform enables you to extend your DevOps workflow to the edge.</h4>\n\n<h2 id=\"benefits-of-devops\">Benefits of DevOps</h2>\n\n<p>DevOps is not a new concept. Far from it. For a little over ten years now, this endearing set of best practices has been making its way into every software development and IT operations team worthy of its name.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, a <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/devops/state-of-devops/\">DevOps report from 2019</a> studied and gathered statistics on how this set of Agile practices makes a difference between teams who adopt it and those who don’t:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/blog/devopsstats.png\" alt=\"devops stats\" /></p>\n\n<p>In short, teams who adopt DevOps are in general more productive, deliver more reliable products, and do all of that much faster.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"continuous-integration--delivery-is-key\">Continuous Integration &amp; Delivery is key</h2>\n\n<p>One of the biggest DevOps tactics is called CI/CD, which stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment. Its purpose is to integrate a trustworthy and automated chain of testing marks into the Agile development process.</p>\n\n<p>For the sake of simplicity, let’s take the following DevOps workflow:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/blog/devops2.jpeg\" alt=\"devops\" /></p>\n\n<p>The Continuous Integration phase consists of everything from planning to coding, building and testing (pretty much the left part of the diagram above). This is where all the automated tests are executed against every new code change, and where your software is compiled and/or built.</p>\n\n<p>Continuous Delivery/Deployment comes after that, by releasing the committed software, and in some cases, deploying it into a QA environment for validation (for example for Canary deployments).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-does-nuvla-have-to-do-with-all-of-this\">What does Nuvla have to do with all of this?</h2>\n\n<p>Being able to continuously deploy your software across a fleet of edge devices sounds ideal. However, most software houses lack the ability to consistently deploy software on edge computing infrastructures. They typically have a large backlog of updates waiting to be manually deployed. This is where Nuvla can help. To get started with Nuvla you only need to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>register with Nuvla and set up your environment</li>\n  <li>prepare your edge device by installing the NuvlaEdge software</li>\n  <li>add your containerised app to Nuvla</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://docs.nuvla.io/\">documentation</a> will support you along the way. And if you hit a snag, simply reach out to us via the little blue widget on the bottom right of any of our websites.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"developers-read-on-️\">Developers, read on ⬇️</h2>\n\n<p>Well, DevOps without tooling would be quite complicated. You’ll easily find a plethora of tools for each step of the DevOps process: Issue Trackers and Scrum Boards for planning (like JIRA), IDEs for coding (like IntelliJ), Source Code Management systems for tracking changes (like GitHub), Continuous Testing applications for testing code changes (like Jenkins and GitHub CI), Continuous Deployment tools for automatic provisioning (like ArgoCD), etc.</p>\n\n<p>So, if you think about it, since Nuvla is basically an application management platform with orchestration capabilities for Docker and Kubernetes environments, why not use it for Continuous Deployment?</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/blog/nuvlacicd.png\" alt=\"cicd\" /></p>\n\n<p>So let’s say you plan for a new feature. An awesome one by the way. First, you develop it. Your code looks neat and tidy, so you commit it. When you commit, your continuous tests will be triggered, and they’ll run all the unit and integration tests to validate that your feature is working properly. And it is, so congrats! Upon this successful step, you will also have another action that will build and push your new code as an artefact (let’s say your final artefact is a Docker Image in Docker Hub). Finally, you want to roll out this new feature to all of your ongoing deployments (be it QA or production). So instead of doing this roll-out manually, why not simply trigger a new continuous action, that will use Nuvla’s REST API to deploy your new application (that is registered in your Nuvla App Store) into your infrastructures (also registered in Nuvla)?</p>\n\n<p>This will give you transparent and infrastructure-agnostic deployments in any compute infrastructure (at the edge or in the cloud), plus you’ll be able to then operate and monitor the lifecycle of your deployments from the Nuvla platform!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"example-of-cd-using-nuvla\">Example of CD using Nuvla</h2>\n\n<p>To help you integrate Nuvla into your CI/CD pipeline, we at SixSq have built a GitHub Action that you can use to automatically deploy an app from Nuvla into an infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>This GitHub Action is called Nuvla Application Deployer and is available in the GitHub marketplace at <a href=\"https://github.com/marketplace/actions/nuvla-application-deployer\">https://github.com/marketplace/actions/nuvla-application-deployer</a>.</p>\n\n<p>To use it, simply make sure your GitHub repositories has the GitHub Actions enabled. In your GitHub Actions Workflow, you can use our Nuvla Application Deployer as a job. Something like this:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>Jobs: continuous-deployment: \n\nruns-on: ubuntu-latest\nname: Deploy application from Nuvla steps: \n\n- name: Deploy\nid: deploy\nuses: nuvla/nuvla-deploy-app-action@v1 with: \n\napi-key: $ api-secret: $ module-id: 'module/&lt;uuid&gt;'\ncredential-id: 'credential/&lt;uuid&gt;' environment: 'NUVLABOX_UUID=nuvlabox/&lt;uuid&gt;' \n\n # Use the output\n- name: Get the output \n\nrun: echo \"The output was $\"  \n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Looks quite straightforward, right? Just to make sure it’s all clear, let’s go through each action input:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>api-key and api-secret: to manage resources in Nuvla, you need to be <a href=\"https://nuvla.io/ui/sign-up\">registered as a user</a>. This GitHub Action will perform an operation on your behalf, so it needs a valid credential for login</li>\n  <li>module-id: you are trying to deploy an application that you, or someone else, have previously registered in Nuvla. If you click on this application, you’ll find an underlying module ID that the GitHub Action will need in order to know which app to deploy.</li>\n  <li>credential-id: Nuvla speaks with infrastructures via their secure API (Docker or Kubernetes). This means all of your infrastructures in Nuvla should have at least one Container Orchestration Engine Credential associated with it.

        "content": "<p><strong>Ekinops, a leading supplier of telecommunications solutions for telecom operators and enterprises, is announcing the acquisition of the start-up SixSq, a software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider for Edge Computing.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Based in Geneva, Switzerland, SixSq has developed an ultra-innovative solution allowing businesses to take full advantage of the added value of Edge Computing. Complementing Cloud computing, the SixSq solution enables smart data processing directly on the company’s site.</p>\n\n<p>The SixSq range comprises the <a href=\"/marketplace\">Nuvla marketplace</a>, which hosts all types of business applications in container format, and the NuvlaEdge software, which converts enterprise routers or other open hardware platforms capable of processing data, into smart edge systems.</p>\n\n<p>The Nuvla marketplace makes available to all devices running the <a href=\"/nuvlaedge\">NuvlaEdge</a> software deployed in the field inside enterprises, all the applications it hosts in the Cloud, similar to the App Store or Play Store for consumers. This way, SixSq makes it possible for all software vendors to reach the enterprise market and sell their innovative software applications.</p>\n\n<p>With this acquisition, <a href=\"https://www.ekinops.com/\">Ekinops</a> is stepping up its strategy to provide greater added value to its customers. <em>“After enriching <a href=\"https://www.ekinops.com/products-services/products/compose/oneos6\">OneOS6</a> middleware with SD-WAN and SBC solutions, it is now possible to extend it to all types of applications through the integration of NuvlaEdge into OneOS6 and access to the Nuvla marketplace. The possibilities are infinite!”</em> said <strong>Didier Brédy, CEO of Ekinops</strong>. <em>“We are looking forward to presenting this opportunity to our telecom operator customers. It is a new way for them to monetize their presence at enterprise branch sites through our OneOS6 routers.”</em></p>\n\n<p><em>“Our solution, already productized, offers a unique value proposition to various verticals such as industry, mass retail and telecoms. For us, joining Ekinops is an enormous accelerator,”</em>  said <strong>Marc-Elian Bégin, co-founder and CEO of SixSq</strong>. <em>“Thanks to Ekinops’ support, we now have the firepower to rapidly move into the B2B market focusing on large accounts and telecom operators. We have already identified opportunities. The market has been waiting for this type of solution, so the timing is perfect,”</em> he said.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"a-key-step-in-the-development-of-ekinops-software-business\">A key step in the development of Ekinops’ software business</h3>\n\n<p>The alliance is a major step forward in Ekinops upscale and software business development strategy.</p>\n\n<p>Ekinops and SixSq solutions are already integrated through the Ekinops virtualization offering (OneOS6-LIM). Next, the goal is to integrate NuvlaEdge software directly into OneOS6 middleware. All OneOS6 routers will be able to run “container” business applications, downloaded via the Nuvla marketplace. Combined with its new 5G routers, Ekinops will make artificial intelligence available to all companies and use cases, particularly for Internet of Things, Industry 4.0 and smart retail.</p>\n\n<p>SixSq is expected to contribute €1m to €2m to revenue in 2022 from its software business. The company is targeting triple-digit growth in the coming years.</p>\n\n<p>In three years’ time, Ekinops aims to generate at least 20% to 30% of its revenue through software and services (vs. 12% in H1 2021).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"transaction-details\">Transaction details</h3>\n\n<p>The transaction consists of the acquisition by Ekinops of 100% of the capital of SixSq SA, which will be consolidated by the Group from November 1, 2021.</p>\n\n<p>This transaction also includes financing from Ekinops to SixSq which will allow the company to significantly increase its sales operation and R&amp;D activities at its Geneva headquarters.</p>\n\n<p>The transaction will have a non-material impact on Ekinops’ 2021 financial statements.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"about-edge-computing\">About Edge Computing</h3>\n\n<p>With the advent of our “all digital” society, the amount of data generated by individuals, employees, machines and everyday devices is experiencing exponential growth. These extensive data sets also need to be processed in near real time. Cloud computing, long used to store and process data, is no longer able to address all our needs. We need to process video in real time, take immediate decisions and process data with a lot less latency. And these requirements apply to numerous fields, including healthcare, smart cities and retail.</p>\n\n<p>Supplementing the capacities of the Cloud, Edge Computing provides users with computing power as close as possible to data sources. This is true for points of presence of telecom operators closest to users (known as “near Edge Computing”) and user sites (“Far Edge Computing”, enabled by SixSq’s technology).</p>\n\n<p>Edge Computing has a host of advantages, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Decision-making proximity: data processing latency is substantially reduced as round trips from and to the Cloud are no longer necessary.</li>\n  <li>Reduced carbon footprint: storing all the raw data of a company in the Cloud weighs heavily on its carbon footprint. Processing data locally reduces the volume of data stored in the Cloud by a factor of 10 to 100.</li>\n  <li>Security and confidentiality: for sensitive data, Edge Computing helps to safeguard confiden-tiality by keeping the data on site and rendering the data anonymous.</li>\n  <li>Economies of scale: while uploading data to the Cloud is not expensive, storing, processing and recovering the data is – even though 90% of raw data are not worth that cost. With Edge Computing, businesses can significantly reduce their Cloud computing bills.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"resources\">Resources</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"/download/news/Ekinops_CP_Acquisition-SixSq_02112021_EN_V9-SixSq-final.pdf\">Press release in PDF</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ekinops.com/news/corporate\">Original from Ekinops</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"your-contacts\">Your contacts</h3>\n\n<p><strong>SixSq</strong></p>\n\n<p>Louise Merifield\n<br />\nOperations Manager and Co-founder\n<br />\n+41 77 44 68 170\n<br />\n<a href=\"mailto:merifield@sixsq.com\">merifield@sixsq.com</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Ekinops</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Ekinops contact:\n<br />\nDidier Brédy\n<br />\nChairman and CEO\n<br />\n<a href=\"mailto:contact@ekinops.com\">contact@ekinops.com</a>\n<br /></li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Investors\n<br />\nMathieu Omnes\n<br />\nInvestor relations\n<br />\n+33 1 53 67 36 92\n<br />\n<a href=\"mailto:momnes@actus.fr\">momnes@actus.fr</a></p>\n  </li>\n  <li>Press\n<br />\nAmaury Dugast\n<br />\nPress relations\n<br />\n+33 1 53 67 36 74\n<br />\n<a href=\"mailto:adugast@actus.fr\">adugast@actus.fr</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"about-sixsq\">About SixSq</h3>\n\n<p>SixSq’s active participation in numerous international edge and cloud initiatives has solidified its reputa-tion as a leading European cloud and edge computing expert.

But when an incident occurs, you want to archive to the cloud as much data as possible to give you insights into what led to this incident: enter the Blackbox app.</h4>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-critical-data\">Protecting critical data</h3>\n\n<p>When an aeroplane crashes, we need to know what happened, not least to prevent the same thing from happening again. The onboard blackbox is crucial in this case as it contains data that will help solve the puzzle.</p>\n\n<p>During normal operations, applications running at the edge are autonomous and go about their business processing data. From this data, only valuable information is transferred to the cloud, delivering the network and storage cost savings that we love about edge computing. Suddenly, a significant event occurs. This could be a critical failure, a crash, an accident or a cyber attack. Then we need the relevant recent data to be archived and protected, just like in an aeroplane. This requirement motivated SixSq Software Engineer <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lionel-s-65a44459/\">Lionel Schaub</a> to develop the BlackBox app.</p>\n\n<p>The BlackBox app kicks in when a significant event is detected. It creates an encrypted <strong>virtual blackbox</strong>, containing all the data it can lay its hands on, and ships it to the cloud for forensic analysis.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-it-works\">How it works</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://nuvla.io/\">Nuvla</a>, SixSq’s edge-to-cloud platform and marketplace, is built to make your life easy when managing devices and applications at the edge. With the NuvlaEdge software you can turn your ARM or x86 computer into a smart edge device, then install and manage your apps with ease. Now with the added protection of the BlackBox app, you can be sure not to miss anything.</p>\n\n<p>The BlackBox app records all the data processed by the edge device.  The local storage is on a rotation, and older data is replaced by new data. This will include, for example, video and audio feeds, as well as any other source of data connected to the edge device, such as sensor and machine measurements of all kinds. The diagram below gives an overview of the workflow.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/blog/bb-overview2.png\" alt=\"blackbox overview\" /></p>\n\n<p class=\"caption\">Figure 1: General overview of the Blackbox.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"inbuilt-security\">Inbuilt security</h3>\n\n<p>The BlackBox app then automatically archives all the available data. However, before it ships the virtual blackbox to its recipient, it <strong>encrypts</strong> and signs its content to protect any sensitive data it may contain. For the same reason you don’t want video and audio feeds to go to the cloud over the wide area network, you don’t want the virtual blackbox to leave the edge without <strong>maximum security</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>For this we use asymmetric key encryption. When the BlackBox app is deployed, a public key is used by the app to encrypt the archive. Therefore, only the holder of the private key will be able to decrypt it. SixSq doesn’t hold this private key, which makes the overall setup very secure.</p>\n\n<p>The virtual blackbox is then pushed to the cloud where it can be retrieved and analysed. The value of the data contained in the virtual blackbox far outweighs any network and storage costs incurred.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the user is informed by the notification and alert feature of <a href=\"https://nuvla.io/\">Nuvla</a>. The message includes a direct link to Nuvla which authenticates the user and allows direct download of the virtual blackbox.</p>\n\n<p>Then, using the private key, the user can decrypt the archive and access all the data leading to the significant event that triggered its creation.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/blog/bb-overview.png\" alt=\"blackbox detailed overview\" /></p>\n\n<p class=\"caption\">Figure 2: Detailed view of how the Blackbox creates an archive and sends it.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"simple-and-efficient-framework\">Simple and efficient framework</h3>\n\n<p>In terms of architecture, the BlackBox app follows best practices, using a local data bus to organise data inside each edge device. Our NuvlaEdge software is composed of micro services. It includes a message bus service (i.e. MQTT) used by the BlackBox app to collect data. Therefore, as long as other apps push their data (raw or pre-processed) to the message bus, the BlackBox app will be able to add the data to a virtual blackbox archive. The solution is therefore simple, yet efficient, and moreover maintenance free.</p>\n\n<p>Sign up for your free trial of Nuvla <a href=\"https://nuvla.io/ui/sign-up\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Find the BlackBox app in the Nuvla Marketplace <a href=\"https://nuvla.io/ui/sign-in?redirect=apps/sixsq/blackbox\">here</a>, including a complete description, license details and affordable pay-as-you-go pricing. And like all other apps in the marketplace, it can be deployed in a click.</p>\n\n<p>As always, if you need help or have questions along the way, get in touch.</p>\n"

They are deployed in a wide range of sectors and markets, ensuring efficient infrastructure management, where analytics is deployed close to the data, instead of moving a huge amount of data to the cloud.</p>\n\n<p>As you scale your fleet of edge devices, you want to know that everything is going well, and if not, you want be told right away so that you can address the issue. You also want to make sure that there are no trigger-happy notifications, which could result in your organisation wasting precious time chasing red herrings.</p>\n\n<p>On the apps side, as you deploy them from your App Store or Marketplace, you also want to ensure updates are taking place and you’re running the right app at the right place and the right time.</p>\n\n<p>At SixSq, we have been working on a “notification” feature able to fulfil this precise need.  Working with early adopters, we have found what we believe to be the right balance in terms of how alerts are defined and detected, as well as the most convenient way to deliver these alerts.</p>\n\n<p>Using <a href=\"https://nuvla.io/\">Nuvla</a> edge management platform, users can now simply register alerts on a number of metrics, such as:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>When a device goes offline and when it comes back online</li>\n  <li>Threshold on telemetry values, for example:\n    <ul>\n      <li>when disk space goes low,</li>\n      <li>memory usage is too high, or</li>\n      <li>CPU usage excessively high</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>And by default, as more edge devices are added, notifications will also also apply to these new devices, making maintenance of alerts a breeze.  Further, notifications can be defined to only alert on a subset of edge devices - e.g. all NuvlaEdge powered devices located in Germany, or from a specific customer or located in a given plant, harbour or airport.</p>\n\n<p>This applies to any edge device running the NuvlaEdge software. If you haven’t installed the NuvlaEdge software on your edge devices yet, we’d be happy to help.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/blog/slack-alert.png\" alt=\"slack alert\" /></p>\n\n<p class=\"caption\">Example of email notification - NuvlaEdge back online.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of delivery mechanism, we have enabled email and Slack.  But if you’re missing your favourite delivery tool, please get in touch and we’ll be more than happy to add more delivery methods.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/blog/email-alert-1.png\" alt=\"slack alert\" /></p>\n\n<p class=\"caption\">Example of Slack notification - NuvlaEdge offline.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/konstantinskaburskas/\">Konstantin Skaburskas</a> led the charge on our side.  Behind the scenes this new feature is based on a new infrastructure service leveraging the Kafka open source software, which is scalable and robust. This also means that <a href=\"https://nuvla.io/\">Nuvla</a> now offers enterprise customers a new event driven interface, such that it can securely be integrated into their overall IT eco-system.</p>\n\n<p>As with everything we do at SixSq, we’re really focused on user and customer feedback.  So let us know how this feature works for you, how we can improve it and evolve it.

        "content": "<p><strong>Citizens and innovators increasingly demand open data, that anyone can access, use and share, to better understand how the city pulses and improve policy decisions.  An effective, secure, non-intrusive and flexible way of providing open data is to leverage edge computing. Edge computing provides a way to deploy realtime services, that avoid data intrusion issues, while enabling an evolutive approach for the city. However, in order to scale and deliver its full innovation potential, edge computing and open data must form the integral part of a governance policy. This blog explores some of the aspects such a governance policy must address and how.</strong></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"governance-for-what\">Governance for what?</h3>\n<p>In previous blog post, we looked at the key drivers for adopting edge computing. In, another blog post, we explored how different sensors (e.g. audio and video) can be combined and reused at the edge.  Edge computing has the ability to transform raw data, such as audio and video streams, into information (e.g. “there’s an accident”) in real-time (here and now). Further, edge computing can produce trending information (e.g. traffic peak and averages, over time, by vehicle category), which can then be aggregated in the cloud (local/private or public) and published as open data. This open data can then be used by a range of users, both public and private, including organisations and citizens.</p>\n\n<p>However, in order to ensure that only curated data is available as open data, robust and clear governance is required.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some of the areas a smart city governance policy should address to provide trusted open data and edge computing:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Applications</li>\n  <li>Data</li>\n  <li>Access</li>\n  <li>Sensors</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Let’s take a closer look at each of these items, and how governance can be achieved.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"applications\">Applications</h4>\n<p>Edge management platforms, such as Nuvla, include the concept of an app store, from which operators of the edge infrastructure can deploy a range of applications. However, in a smart city context, it is paramount that only safe and secure applications are deployed on its edge infrastructure. Therefore, an application certification process must be put in place.</p>\n\n<p>Such an edge application policy could include, for example, that the application only communicates data to the city open data storage. Or that detected events are only sent to recognised authorities.  Another important point could be that apps don’t forward any data or information which intrudes into a citizen’s privacy.</p>\n\n<p>A pragmatic way to start upon an app certification processes could be to inspect and test each application. Once the app is certified, it can then be granted the appropriate rights, such that the smart city edge operator can deploy it.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"data\">Data</h4>\n<p>Another important aspect of governance should relate to the type of information transferred to the cloud and included as open data. For example, ensuring that only trend information, such as aggregated averages, minimum and maximum values over time, is good and simple start.  For traffic data this is how it could look like:</p>\n\n<p>min, max and average vehicle every 10 mins, for each measurement location, \ncategorisation of vehicles percentage of the same time period.\nWhat should not be included is any data that could identify an individual, either directly (e.g. voice or image) or indirectly (e.g. unique identifier that could be used to identify an individual over time).</p>\n\n<p>In our previous blog on data fusion, we explore how forensic data can be used to assist enquiries (e.g. video and audio stream of an accident), but to be clear, this type of data should never be confused with open data. Forensic data should be encrypted and only delivered to authorities able to decrypt it, and under strict conditions. The beauty of an edge management platform is that it allows all of this fine tuning to take place.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"access\">Access</h4>\n<p>Controlling who has access to the management functions of the system is also paramount. To this end, management platforms, such as Nuvla, have advanced authorisation features, ensuring only members of a given group are allowed to perform specific actions. It is therefore straightforward to configure the edge infrastructure devices to only be available to users in a certain group.</p>\n\n<p>Further, all important actions are logged, thus leaving an audit trail. This can then be used by any controlling authority to review what actions were performed, by whom and when.</p>\n\n<p>On the applications side, only certified application versions should be available to the group managing the edge infrastructure, such that only these are deployed and updated.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"sensors\">Sensors</h4>\n<p>What type of sensors can be used is another aspect an edge computing governance policy should consider. When correctly implemented, edge computing means sensors can be isolated. For example, if the only path to the network for a sensor is via the edge device it is attached to, it means it is not be able to reach out to unknown services on the wide area network. This means a wider range of sensors could be used safely, since any network route would end in the secure edge device.  And since we have fine control over how each edge device communicates, we can ensure that no backdoor is present. This can significantly reduce costs by widening the palette of sensors that can be deployed.</p>\n\n<p>Open Data exploitation\nOnce the system is in place, users will be able to access clean, safe, valuable and reliable information, in the form of curated data, produced by fleets of edge devices.</p>\n\n<p>Looking at our traffic data example, this means that users would be able to query the open data system to extract trending information, such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>traffic highs and lows over days, during week days vs weekends, school holidays vs working days.</li>\n  <li>proportion of trucks vs cars vs bicycles vs pedestrians across the city to understand usage pattern.</li>\n  <li>impact on traffic across events such as accidents, road works or speed reduction experiments.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This could be replicated for each and every data set gathered across the city. The transformative impact of having readily available data, refreshed constantly, is potentially significant. And as more data sets are added to the system, e.g. air quality measurements, noise level, light intensity and energy consumption, the better the understanding of all stakeholders.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"bringing-it-all-together\">Bringing it all together</h4>\n<p>In this blog, we have sketched out an outline of what a smart city governance policy could look like, to ensure all stakeholders can reap the benefits of edge computing and open data, safely, and with sufficient agility to evolve with the city’s future needs.</p>\n\n<p>Adding a certification process to edge platforms such as Nuvla enhances the value of the <strong>app marketplace</strong>. This means application vendors could register edge (and cloud) applications, allowing cities to deploy these apps with confidence.  This is a powerful concept that will allow smart city operators and application developers to work together to improve services and innovate.</p>\n\n<p>Our objective is for this post to be used as a trigger towards the elaboration of a governance policy that can be tested in real life, over a real edge infrastructure, in real-life conditions. Of course, if you are interested in this process, please get in touch.</p>\n\n"

        "content": "<p><strong>Edge computing, with its ability to process data near its source, delivers secure and future proof solutions, without a round trip to the cloud. In this blog post, we explore examples of how data coming from a variety of simple sensors can be combined to produce better and new smart city services.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This blog is co-authored with guest author <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gmeleder/\">Glenn Meleder</a>, CEO and Founder of <a href=\"https://securaxis.com/\">Securaxis</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"smart-city-challenges\">Smart City Challenges</h3>\n\n<p>The smart city market is in fast and constant evolution. This phenomenon is echoed in other markets, such an transport, energy, medical and retail.</p>\n\n<p>The key drivers for implementing an edge computing solution include low latency, bandwidth limitation, privacy intrusion prevention and jittery networks. The upcoming 5G deployments won’t change this, since even 5G will not be able to deliver guaranteed low latency at scale, at the same time as dealing with high data throughput. And as sensory data is growing faster than networking capacity, the edge computing paradigm shift is the only sustainable option.</p>\n\n<p>Looking forward, smart cities will have a lot on their to do list. Infrastructure-related services, will need to deliver:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>better security for citizens,</li>\n  <li>more effective services,</li>\n  <li>lowered maintenance costs,</li>\n  <li>improved emergency services,</li>\n  <li>better understanding of pollution (e.g. air, sound, light), leading to more effective counter measures,</li>\n  <li>streamlined traffic</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>…and much more.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"status-quo-wont-work\">Status quo won’t work</h3>\n\n<p>The current trend of vertical or integrated solutions for each of the applications mentioned above is doomed to fail, due to complexity and operations costs. Think about it, if every solution requires its own sensor, communication pack, power supply, cloud management application, pricing, terms and conditions and operations procedure… ouch! A better solution is “data fusion” at the edge, and here’s how it works.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"data-fusion-in-action\">Data Fusion in action</h3>\n\n<p>Audio and video sensors provide the majority of raw sensory material needed in the smart city use cases listed above. And since the same sensor data is required for several applications, it follows that these should be reused across the different apps. This calls for an edge computing solution, where the video and audio streams are processed near the sensors, such that all applications can use and re-use the same high quality data.</p>\n\n<p>Many smart city apps will greatly benefit from being able to process audio and video data together. By processing both data streams at the same time, application developers are able to deliver much improved and new services. Here are some good examples of where data fusion can be helpful:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>audio and video forensics can be provided to back a decision to send an alert to the emergency services following a detected accident</li>\n  <li>degradation of infrastructures (e.g. graffiti or vandalism), as well as noisy or degraded vehicles can be detected using audio and identified using video</li>\n  <li>the cause of a peak of particles pollution can be linked to categories of vehicle or malfunctioning machines.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Using a <a href=\"https://nuvla.io/\">management platform</a>, edge devices can be remote controlled and updated “over the air”. When combined with an app store (yes like Apple’s App Store or Google Play Store), the management platform provides smart city operators the ability to constantly update, add and upgrade their fleet of apps running at the edge. This also allows operation teams to react to cyber attacks in order to deploy counter measures and update apps quickly, thus reducing the impact of such attacks.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/blog/edge-1.png\" alt=\"Nuvla edge\" /></p>\n\n<p class=\"caption\">Nuvla edge architecture, with App Store and data fusion at the edge.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"data-forensics-as-part-of-secure-governance\">Data forensics as part of secure governance</h3>\n\n<p>Since the data is processed at the edge, no sensitive data is systematically streamed to the cloud for processing. Indeed, the data remains just for a short duration at the edge, from which only relevant events are derived, providing real-time actions or aggregated and anonymised trending data (e.g. traffic measurements, over time and by vehicle category). However, in some cases, we can “have our cake and eat it”. In the case where forensic data is required to support investigations, short video and audio sequences can be saved, compressed, encrypted, and finally, delivered to the appropriate authorities. Using asymmetric encryption, the edge system can encrypt the data with a public key, such that only the owners of the private key (e.g. law enforcement) can decrypt the data. As long as this process is part of proper governance procedures, the edge system will protect citizens, and deliver, in case of necessity and under strict control, forensic evidence to support investigations and follow-up actions.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"can-we-be-future-proof\">Can we be future proof?</h3>\n\n<p>As we mentioned earlier, like many markets, smart cities are in constant evolution. This leads to the need of deploying solutions that are “future proof”. Edge computing software can ensure that future needs will be fulfilled without re-hauling the hardware infrastructure. This means that edge infrastructure can be deployed today and repurposed over time and the needs of the city evolves.</p>\n\n<p>And this ability to evolve is not limited to smart cities, since it will equally apply to the other markets mentioned earlier.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"can-we-help\">Can we help?</h3>\n\n<p>We have experience with implementing edge solutions for smart cities and other markets, so don’t hesitate to contact us if you need support with assessing the potential benefits of edge computing.</p>\n\n<p>As strong proponents of open source, open data and open systems, you can count on our independent advice.</p>\n\n"

Adopting DevOps principles is therefore the natural way to go. In this blog, we explore how the Nuvla application management platform enables you to extend your DevOps workflow to the edge.</h4>\n\n<h2 id=\"benefits-of-devops\">Benefits of DevOps</h2>\n\n<p>DevOps is not a new concept. Far from it. For a little over ten years now, this endearing set of best practices has been making its way into every software development and IT operations team worthy of its name.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, a <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/devops/state-of-devops/\">DevOps report from 2019</a> studied and gathered statistics on how this set of Agile practices makes a difference between teams who adopt it and those who don’t:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/blog/devopsstats.png\" alt=\"devops stats\" /></p>\n\n<p>In short, teams who adopt DevOps are in general more productive, deliver more reliable products, and do all of that much faster.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"continuous-integration--delivery-is-key\">Continuous Integration &amp; Delivery is key</h2>\n\n<p>One of the biggest DevOps tactics is called CI/CD, which stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment. Its purpose is to integrate a trustworthy and automated chain of testing marks into the Agile development process.</p>\n\n<p>For the sake of simplicity, let’s take the following DevOps workflow:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/blog/devops2.jpeg\" alt=\"devops\" /></p>\n\n<p>The Continuous Integration phase consists of everything from planning to coding, building and testing (pretty much the left part of the diagram above). This is where all the automated tests are executed against every new code change, and where your software is compiled and/or built.</p>\n\n<p>Continuous Delivery/Deployment comes after that, by releasing the committed software, and in some cases, deploying it into a QA environment for validation (for example for Canary deployments).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-does-nuvla-have-to-do-with-all-of-this\">What does Nuvla have to do with all of this?</h2>\n\n<p>Being able to continuously deploy your software across a fleet of edge devices sounds ideal. However, most software houses lack the ability to consistently deploy software on edge computing infrastructures. They typically have a large backlog of updates waiting to be manually deployed. This is where Nuvla can help. To get started with Nuvla you only need to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>register with Nuvla and set up your environment</li>\n  <li>prepare your edge device by installing the NuvlaEdge software</li>\n  <li>add your containerised app to Nuvla</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://docs.nuvla.io/\">documentation</a> will support you along the way. And if you hit a snag, simply reach out to us via the little blue widget on the bottom right of any of our websites.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"developers-read-on-️\">Developers, read on ⬇️</h2>\n\n<p>Well, DevOps without tooling would be quite complicated. You’ll easily find a plethora of tools for each step of the DevOps process: Issue Trackers and Scrum Boards for planning (like JIRA), IDEs for coding (like IntelliJ), Source Code Management systems for tracking changes (like GitHub), Continuous Testing applications for testing code changes (like Jenkins and GitHub CI), Continuous Deployment tools for automatic provisioning (like ArgoCD), etc.</p>\n\n<p>So, if you think about it, since Nuvla is basically an application management platform with orchestration capabilities for Docker and Kubernetes environments, why not use it for Continuous Deployment?</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/blog/nuvlacicd.png\" alt=\"cicd\" /></p>\n\n<p>So let’s say you plan for a new feature. An awesome one by the way. First, you develop it. Your code looks neat and tidy, so you commit it. When you commit, your continuous tests will be triggered, and they’ll run all the unit and integration tests to validate that your feature is working properly. And it is, so congrats! Upon this successful step, you will also have another action that will build and push your new code as an artefact (let’s say your final artefact is a Docker Image in Docker Hub). Finally, you want to roll out this new feature to all of your ongoing deployments (be it QA or production). So instead of doing this roll-out manually, why not simply trigger a new continuous action, that will use Nuvla’s REST API to deploy your new application (that is registered in your Nuvla App Store) into your infrastructures (also registered in Nuvla)?</p>\n\n<p>This will give you transparent and infrastructure-agnostic deployments in any compute infrastructure (at the edge or in the cloud), plus you’ll be able to then operate and monitor the lifecycle of your deployments from the Nuvla platform!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"example-of-cd-using-nuvla\">Example of CD using Nuvla</h2>\n\n<p>To help you integrate Nuvla into your CI/CD pipeline, we at SixSq have built a GitHub Action that you can use to automatically deploy an app from Nuvla into an infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>This GitHub Action is called Nuvla Application Deployer and is available in the GitHub marketplace at <a href=\"https://github.com/marketplace/actions/nuvla-application-deployer\">https://github.com/marketplace/actions/nuvla-application-deployer</a>.</p>\n\n<p>To use it, simply make sure your GitHub repositories has the GitHub Actions enabled. In your GitHub Actions Workflow, you can use our Nuvla Application Deployer as a job. Something like this:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>Jobs: continuous-deployment: \n\nruns-on: ubuntu-latest\nname: Deploy application from Nuvla steps: \n\n- name: Deploy\nid: deploy\nuses: nuvla/nuvla-deploy-app-action@v1 with: \n\napi-key: $ api-secret: $ module-id: 'module/&lt;uuid&gt;'\ncredential-id: 'credential/&lt;uuid&gt;' environment: 'NUVLABOX_UUID=nuvlabox/&lt;uuid&gt;' \n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<h1 id=\"use-the-output\">Use the output</h1>\n<ul>\n  <li>name: Get the output</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>run: echo “The output was $”</p>\n\n<p>Looks quite straightforward, right? Just to make sure it’s all clear, let’s go through each action input:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>api-key and api-secret: to manage resources in Nuvla, you need to be <a href=\"https://nuvla.io/ui/sign-up\">registered as a user</a>. This GitHub Action will perform an operation on your behalf, so it needs a valid credential for login</li>\n  <li>module-id: you are trying to deploy an application that you, or someone else, have previously registered in Nuvla. If you click on this application, you’ll find an underlying module ID that the GitHub Action will need in order to know which app to deploy.</li>\n  <li>credential-id: Nuvla speaks with infrastructures via their secure API (Docker or Kubernetes). This means all of your infrastructures in Nuvla should have at least one Container Orchestration Engine Credential associated with it. This ID will tell GitHub Action which credential to use when deploying your app in the infrastructure. You can find this credential from the Credentials page in Nuvla.</li>\n  <li>environment: finally, this optional input lets you define environment variables for your application. Assuming your Nuvla app has been configured to accept these variables, all you need to do is to provide them to the GitHub Action, as a comma-separated string, making sure the variable names match with the ones in the corresponding Nuvla application.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If the action fails, it will try to auto-clean whatever deployments have been started, otherwise, on success, it will output the ID of your deployment, which you can capture via the workflow variable:</p>\n\n<p>steps.test.outputs.DEPLOYMENT_ID</p>\n\n<p>Now you can manage the lifecycle of your edge applications much more easily.</p>\n\n<p>Continuous Deployment is just one of the many benefits of using Nuvla.  There are several ways you can dig deeper, so why not take a look then contact us if you need a helping hand? And we are always interested to hear about your experience. So don’t hesitate to get in touch.</p>\n"

        "content": "<p>This is the second blog post in the series on <strong>Data management with <a href=\"https://nuvla.io/\">Nuvla</a></strong>. Nuvla is an edge management platform as a service, designed to make it easy for you to manage, monitor, deploy and update your containerised apps and edge devices.</p>\n\n<p>Here we will show you how easily you or your customers can manage any data on S3 (store, register, search and download) either on Cloud or Edge using Nuvla.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"easy-handling-of-s3-objects-with-nuvla\">Easy handling of S3 objects with Nuvla</h3>\n\n<p>In the first blog we covered at a high level the ways it is possible to register and use data on the Edge or Cloud with Nuvla. Here we will delve into the details and present a cool feature of Nuvla that greatly simplifies the building of your Edge and Cloud data catalogues and providing access to the data to any user.</p>\n\n<p>But before we do that, here are the benefits of doing this with Nuvla:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>No S3 client is needed! Yes, that’s right.</li>\n  <li>No S3 credentials are shared with your users/customers for data upload and download.</li>\n  <li>Categorisation of your data with an arbitrary schema.</li>\n  <li>Reach and fast search over your data’s meta-data.</li>\n  <li>Nuvla application orchestrator leveraging the meta-data catalogue and starting applications where the data is and with the data attached.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This translates into the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>greatly simplifies your data management</li>\n  <li>provides a complete integration of your data across clouds and edge</li>\n  <li>removes hurdles and erases boundaries for data engineers and developers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is a holistic approach to management and processing of your data wherever it is. In other words, it creates a continuum between the cloud and the edge.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"register-s3-endpoint\">Register S3 Endpoint</h3>\n\n<p>As we will be working here with S3, we need to tell Nuvla the S3 endpoint and credentials. You can use any S3 endpoint as long as it has AWS S3 compliant API: e.g. <a href=\"https://min.io/\">MinIO</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/radosgw/\">Ceph RadosGW</a>, etc., and it doesn’t matter whether it’s running at the Edge or in the Cloud.</p>\n\n<p>To add the S3 endpoint and credentials, use the <strong>Infrastructures</strong> and <strong>Credentials</strong> tabs in Nuvla.</p>\n\n<p>For more details see our documentation on management of <a href=\"https://docs.nuvla.io/nuvla/user-guide/infrastructures/\">Infrastructure Services in Nuvla</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Here it’s how you can do this with our <a href=\"https://github.com/nuvla/python-library\">Python API library</a>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>from nuvla.api import Api as Nuvla\nfrom nuvla.api.resources.infra_service import (InfraServiceGroup,\n                                               InfraServiceS3,\n                                               CredentialS3)\nnuvla = Nuvla()\n\nnuvla.login('&lt;login params&gt;')\n\ngroup_id = InfraServiceGroup(nuvla).add('S3')\n\ninfra_s3 = InfraServiceS3(nuvla).add('https://s3.endpoint', group_id , 'My S3')\n\ns3cred_id = CredentialS3('s3 key', 's3 secret', infra_s3, 'My S3 cred')\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<h3 id=\"upload-data-to-s3-and-register-it-in-nuvla\">Upload data to S3 and Register it in Nuvla</h3>\n\n<p>Once your S3 endpoint is registered in Nuvla, you are ready to start uploading data to S3 and registering it with Nuvla.</p>\n\n<p>Here are the steps describing how this is done (any HTTP client can be used):</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Create data-object record by providing S3 bucket, object path, and the ID of S3 credentials. This will return the ID of the new data-object resource.</li>\n  <li>Call the upload operation on it. This returns the S3 pre-signed upload URL.</li>\n  <li>Upload your object to S3 using the pre-signed upload URL from 2.</li>\n  <li>Set the object as ready by calling the ready operation.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>As you can see, this can easily be scripted or programmed in any language that has an HTTP library. The bucket will be created on S3 by Nuvla if it doesn’t exist when calling the upload operation (see step 2. above). Also, steps 1., 2. and 4. can be done using the Nuvla UI. Additionally, by setting the appropriate ACLs (Access Control List) you control who can see the object and what operation can be performed. Usually you set read-only ACLs for the user by forbidding the deletion of the object.</p>\n\n<p>In our Python API library we wrapped the above four actions into a single call for your convenience.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>from nuvla.api.resources.data import DataObjectS3\n\nobj_id = DataObjectS3(nuvla).create(open('data/african-lion.jpg').read(), 'cloud.animals', 'africa/african-lion.jpg', s3_cred_id)\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>There are more options to the object creation available - like setting object content type, md5sum, tags, giving the object a friendly name in Nuvla, etc.</p>\n\n<p>More information can be found in our online documentation:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.nuvla.io/nuvla/advanced-usage/manage-data\">Data management model</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.nuvla.io/tutorials/data/manage-data-with-api\">Example on data management</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"search\">Search</h3>\n\n<p>Nuvla has a powerful search API. Now, that your object is in S3 and registered in Nuvla, it can be found by searching <strong>data-object</strong> resources either directly through the API or the API section of the UI, as seen in the screenshot below.</p>\n\n<p>Because there is no need to search through objects’ meta-data directly on S3, the operation is extremely fast, leveraging Elasticsearch that is used by Nuvla under the hood.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/blog/data-object-search.png\" alt=\"data object search\" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"download-no-s3-credentials-or-s3-client-needed\">Download: No S3 credentials or S3 client needed</h3>\n<p>When the required object is found (see screenshot above; bucket and tags keys are used), the user can either:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>request S3 pre-signed object download URL from Nuvla by clicking on the <strong>download</strong> button (see screenshot below), or</li>\n  <li>start an application requesting this object to be mounted to or already present in the container.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This second - more powerful option - will be described in our next blog posts.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/blog/data-object-download.png\" alt=\"data object download\" /></p>\n\n<p>As you can see, users with whom you’ve shared the access to the data-object in Nuvla, don’t have to possess credentials of your S3. And now downloading the file from S3 can be done with any HTTP client, as in the example below:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>$ curl --output lion.jpg \"https://sos-ch-gva-2.exo.io/cloud.animals/africa/african-lion.jpg?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200531T220403Z&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Expires=899&amp;X-Amz-Credential=EXOcc19d8afde0f4eac4675426a%2F20200531%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Signature=f3817e96207fc2dae41da804fade1c490f44c49aa85a821656b7bc7166994517\"\n\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n\n100 29191  100 29191    0     0   140k      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  139k\n\n$ ls lion.jpg\n\nlion.jpg\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<h3 id=\"next-steps\">Next steps</h3>\n<p>In this blog, we’ve covered a very cool feature of Nuvla that allows you to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>store, search, and download your data to/on/from S3;</li>\n  <li>share data with your users/clients without giving them credentials of your S3;</li>\n  <li>and you don’t need an S3 client neither for object upload nor download.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In the next blog post on this topic, we will cover in details data-records.</p>\n\n<p>While, as you could already see, tags on data-object gives a sense of meta-data that can be used for object identification, data-record is specifically designed to be your object’s meta-data store. After that we will demonstrate how to start your container application on a set of data using Nuvla’s data-set. We will finish by describing how all this works in the GNSS Big Data project, where Nuvla is at the heart of the distributed platform for GNSS data collection and processing at the Edge and in the Cloud.</p>\n\n<p>Follow us on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/sixsq/\">LinkedIn</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sixsq\">Twitter</a> to make sure don’t miss when the next blog is published!</p>\n"

Nuvla is an edge management platform as a service, designed to make it easy for you to manage, monitor, deploy and update your containerised apps and edge devices.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Data scientists</strong> have to make sense of messy, unstructured data to uncover solutions for scientific, technological and business challenges. These blog posts are aimed at data scientists looking for a more efficient way to manage, process and analyse that data.</p>\n\n<p>In these posts you will learn about:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the set of features available in Nuvla</li>\n  <li>what you can achieve with them</li>\n  <li>how this works in practice.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Keep with us until the end, as we will give you an insight into the ESA GNSS Big Data project, which uses Nuvla for data management.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"making-sense-of-large-data-sets\">Making sense of large data sets</h3>\n\n<p>Large data sets, produced and stored on the edge and in the cloud, need to be made available for post-processing and analysis to facilitate extraction of valuable information. Nuvla enables this process by providing users with data management capabilities in the form of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>data registration,</li>\n  <li>a powerful search engine,</li>\n  <li>meta-data updates,</li>\n  <li>selection of applications that can work with particular data types and</li>\n  <li>directing data processing applications to where the data is actually located.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All this is possible via a rich web UI and API.</p>\n\n<p>Below, we describe a number of building blocks (or elements) and operations on them available in Nuvla to support user <strong>data management in distributed environments</strong>. We present you with a powerful “Open with…” pattern, allowing users to automatically deploy their data processing applications directly where the data is located.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"elements--operations-of-nuvla-data-management\">Elements &amp; operations of Nuvla data management</h3>\n<p>Nuvla defines a number of elements (resources) and operations on them that help users to work with their data stored on the edge or in the cloud. Let’s go through them:</p>\n\n<p>ELEMENTS (RESOURCES)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Infrastructure-Service and Infrastructure-Credential</strong></p>\n\n<p>These resources contain endpoints and credentials of the storage (e.g. S3) and/or cluster (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm) where the data is located. The data resources (detailed below) reference these infrastructure resources.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Infrastructure-Service-Group</strong></p>\n\n<p>This allows grouping of cluster and storage Infrastructure-Services to identify storage and processing proximity.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Data-Record</strong></p>\n\n<p>This resource keeps information about the user data in a user-defined schema. The fields in the schema can contain scalars (e.g. strings, booleans) and collections (e.g. set of key/value pairs, geo-spatial points). It also allows users to link each particular data record with its location - Infrastructure-Service. The user can define and set a data type for each record. This helps to find applications supporting this data type.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Data-Object</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is an S3 object with a predefined workflow on it. It is a very powerful resource for working with data on S3 and is described in the online <a href=\"https://docs.nuvla.io/nuvla/advanced-usage/manage-data#data-object-resources\">Nuvla documentation</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Data-Set</strong></p>\n\n<p>This provides a virtual snapshot view over the data defined by the user query on the data records or objects.</p>\n\n<p>OPERATIONS</p>\n\n<p><strong>CRUD and actions</strong></p>\n\n<p>Nuvla provides a full set of CRUD operations over all the data elements, and extends them with a set of resource specific actions (see <a href=\"https://docs.nuvla.io/nuvla/advanced-usage/manage-data#data-object-resources\">Data-Object documentation</a>).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Query</strong></p>\n\n<p>A simple and powerful query language which allows you to query data records and data objects. A full text search is available for the data sets.</p>\n\n<p>Each data record or object has a creation timestamp which means that they, as well as the data sets, can also be <strong>filtered by time</strong>. Nuvla allows users to have geo-spatial data fields in the data records and run point and shape queries over them.</p>\n\n<p>Users can persist their queries over the data as data sets. This creates virtual dynamic snapshots over the data that can be acted upon - e.g. with “Open with…”.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Open with…</strong></p>\n\n<p>In Nuvla, applications can be marked with a list of data types they support.</p>\n\n<p>By utilising the data binding defined on the applications and the data types in Data-Records, and in combination with knowing where the data is located (via the link of data to the Infrastructure-Service), Nuvla allows users to automatically direct the deployment of applications close to the data.</p>\n\n<p>This operation is usually done on data sets. Launching an application on the selected data sets we call “Open with…” feature. At the moment, the data sets must reside on a single location, but we are exploring possibilities of deploying the user workloads simultaneously in multiple locations as well.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"an-example-of-data-management-workflow\">An example of data management workflow.</h3>\n\n<p>The rich set of functionalities described above allows our clients to push their boundaries by bridging the gap between edge and cloud. A good example of this is the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8XD8bHceOY\">GNNS Big Data Project</a>.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/blog/edge-to-cloud-big-data.png\" alt=\"Nuvla edge\" /></p>\n\n<p>A typical workflow of working with data could look as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Store files on the storage local to the place where the data was collected or produced,</li>\n  <li>Register meta-data about the data and its location in Nuvla.</li>\n  <li>Build and register queries over the data. This produces data sets.</li>\n  <li>Tag the data by types that define which applications can work with it.</li>\n  <li>Create applications that can work with the specific data types.</li>\n  <li>Use “Open with…” feature to select data set(s) and launch the application on them.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Let’s go through the steps in more detail.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Steps 1. and 2.</strong> are usually combined into a store-and-register step:</p>\n\n<p>Store data as files on local storage of the edge device and register the data in Nuvla. The local storage can be of any type. For example, it can be S3 Ceph RadosGW physically persisting data on Ceph pools defined on Ceph object store. Or it can be a distributed file system (e.g. NFS, GlusterFS, CephFS). In each of the cases, the stored files can be registered in Nuvla with information defining the reference to the edge device, type of the storage and path to the file on that storage. In the case of S3, this will be a reference to the S3 infrastructure service pre-defined by user in Nuvla, that has the endpoint of the S3 and, in turn, reference to credentials to access this S3 endpoint.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 3</strong> allows users to create filters over the meta-data for which they registered their data. It can be geo-special queries or queries over the specific data sub-types, data creation time, etc.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 4</strong> is possible as part of Step 2. or as a separate update action.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 5</strong> is where users build applications from scratch or find existing ones in Nuvla App store, and add a corresponding data type binding to them. This signals to Nuvla that this app can work with the particular data type.</p>\n\n<p>Step 6 Nuvla facilitates users with the deployment of the right application on the data at the location where the data is actually residing.</p>\n\n<p>Building the described workflow can be achieved by combining the usage of Nuvla API, client API libraries (available in Python, C and ClojureScript), and web UI.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"nuvla-as-a-meta-data-catalogue\">Nuvla as a meta-data catalogue</h3>\n\n<p>From the description of available resources, operations and the example workflow, we hope to have shown you that Nuvla acts as <strong>meta-data catalogue</strong> with links between data, infrastructure resources and applications. This allows for a rich set of functionalities and patterns to be built around that by any user.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"whats-next\">What’s next?</h3>\n\n<p>In the next posts we will explore how to use the data management features of Nuvla using the UI and API. This will help you understand how this actually works in practice and allow you to apply this knowledge to managing and processing your own data across edge and cloud.</p>\n"

Efficient and rapid analysis and dissemination of this data is critical in the face of today’s environmental challenges. The data, however, cannot be effectively exploited due to a lack of a single platform giving access across all environmental topics and to all countries. This problem led to UN Environment and UNEP/GRID-Geneva establishing a joint initiative in 2014 known as MapX. MapX capitalises on the use of new digital technologies and cloud computing for the <strong>sustainable management of natural resources.</strong> <em>“MapX is the first attempt to aggregate the range of geospatial information on the environment into a single cloud platform that is backed with the UN neutrality,”</em> said Pierre Lacroix, head of unit at UNEP/GRID-Geneva. <em>“It provides reliable information to match data producers with decision makers, while also offering smart tools and dashboards for analysis, dissemination and storytelling.”</em></p>\n\n<p>MapX is supporting the future data and Knowledge platform for the <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/\">United Nations Environment Programme</a> (UNEP).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Scaling up to reach a large user base</strong></p>\n\n<p>The MapX application needs to mature rapidly, while ensuring it is able to scale with the expected increase in demand from users. Due to the technical challenges, especially on the server-side of the application and its integration into cloud environments, SixSq is providing consultancy services with the objective of reducing costs, improving service resilience and increasing the rate of innovation.</p>\n\n<p>SixSq CEO, Marc-Elian Bégin said <em>“It’s an honour to be able to help the MapX team to reach their challenging scaling goal, while remaining independent from infrastructure providers. Leveraging our DevOps and cloud experience, we’re able to take a lot of the operational pain from the team, so that they can focus on delivering innovation to the climate change monitoring community.”</em></p>\n\n<p>Working together, MapX now runs a scalable and clustered set of services, including PostgreSQL, Redis and Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring. The new container native application is now set to scale with demand. This demand is expected to grow with the increasing need from the UN community to understand and report on the impact on land from climate change and mitigation measures implemented by countries and regions.</p>\n\n<p>Useful links</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mapx.org/\">mapx.org</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://unepgrid.ch/en\">unepgrid.ch</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352711018300177\">sciencedirect.com</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>About MapX</strong></p>\n\n<p>MapX was developed by UNEP, the World Bank and UNEP/GRID-Geneva to capitalize on the use of new digital technologies and cloud computing in the sustainable management of natural resources. One of the founding principles was to equalize information held by different stakeholders as a prerequisite to better dialogue, decision making and monitoring. MapX evolved from an initial focus on extractive resources to include a range of different resource types and themes</p>\n\n<p><strong>About GRID-Geneva</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Global Resource Information Database - Geneva (GRID-Geneva), is a partnership between the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN) and the University of Geneva (UniGe).

        "content": "<p><strong>Edge Computing is one of the latest buzz expressions in the ICT world, along with IoT, big data and artificial intelligence.</strong></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-is-edge-computing\">What is Edge Computing?</h3>\n\n<p>Edge computing refers to providing data processing power at the edge of a network, near where the data is produced and collected, as opposed to transferring the raw data to the cloud, or a central data warehouse, for processing. “So what?” you may well ask. “Why do we need yet more ways for processing and storing data?” or “Why not let all the sensors send their data over the network to a cloud?” The fact is that a lot of data is produced at the edge, and this trend is predicted to massively accelerate.  Furthermore, even if you could send all of this data reliably AND securely to a cloud, in many cases this data would lose its value by taking too long to be processed.  In some cases this is not important, but in others it is critical. If you want to know whether someone is hacking a critical infrastructure, or want to adjust light intensity to improve the safety of motorists, you need the most up-to-date information. Waiting for the data to make its way back to a cloud or data centre for analysis is likely not to be good enough or safe enough.</p>\n\n<p>Edge computing can take the form of micro data centres or small machines placed in remote locations, or at the edge of the network, to provide real-time insights into data. It then acts as an aggregator or a gateway when operated in conjunction with wireless sensor networks, high-definition audio or video equipment and so on.</p>\n\n<p>In a nutshell, <strong>edge computing enables the transformation of data into information, at the edge</strong>. The benefits are considerable:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Access all of the data, without network limitation</li>\n  <li>Provide a new line of defence against cyber attacks</li>\n  <li>Improve responsiveness of systems, taking advantage of local decision-making capabilities</li>\n  <li>Anonymise data during the transformation process, avoiding data privacy issues</li>\n  <li>Massively reduce network usage, since only processed and valuable information is transferred from the edge to the cloud and back</li>\n  <li>Reduce costs in operations and centralise resource needs</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now let’s look at a few concrete applications of edge computing.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"examples-of-edge-computing\">Examples of Edge Computing</h3>\n\n<h4 id=\"mobility\">Mobility</h4>\n<p>Next generation systems, embedded with high density connected components, promise to be an enormous source of data. For example, the C-Series, the latest airplane by Bombardier, could be producing over 844 TB of data per 12 hours flight.  Clearly, airlines operating fleets of this type of craft will be faced with a deluge of data.</p>\n\n<p>It is not realistic, nor sensible, to transfer, store and process this much data.  Analysis applications need structured information instead, in order to predict important events and derive significant trends.  This information, using edge computing, could be produced from the raw data, closer to the components or system generating the data. In this example of the C-Series, the aircraft itself is probably the right place to perform this type of data transformation.</p>\n\n<p>Closer to the ground, tramway systems can leverage data from sensors along the route to improve safety and service for commuters. Take a look at the work of the <a href=\"https://elastic-project.eu/\">ELASTIC</a> project to get an idea of what can be done.  The software architecture is being tested in the city of Florence, Italy, and equips tram vehicles with V2X communication and a variety of detectors aimed at improving traffic management, allowing predictive maintenance and enhancing the tramway operation.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"smart-public-lighting\">Smart Public Lighting</h4>\n<p>Another example of smart use of data at the edge is the ability to control street lighting based on traffic level.  Here, light intensity is adjusted in real time, based on the volume of traffic passing. This not only ensures safety for motorists and pedestrians, it also offers a huge opportunity to municipalities and transport ministries to reduce energy bills and meet environmental targets. If you would like to read more about this example, take a look at our City Use Case page.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"retail\">Retail</h4>\n<p>Retail stores are struggling to keep up with on-line commerce. To close the gap between e-commerce analytics and in-store analytics, stores can implement an edge computing strategy. By using video analytics software, including AI, for facial recognition, such a solution could provide a near real-time notification mechanism to alert store staff when opted-in customers enter the store. This could provide customers with the personalised shopping experience they are looking for. In addition, real-time, anonymised behaviour analytics can give store managers a deeper understanding of customer behaviour and provide date to improve store layout etc.  Take a look at our retail use case for a deeper understanding.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"edge-computing-at-sixsq\">Edge Computing at SixSq</h3>\n\n<p>Coming from a cloud computing background, we have long realised that the benefits of cloud computing could be miniaturised into a platform now called edge computing.  Our NuvlaEdge software creates a hyperconverged edge computing solution.  The example above on smart lighting is a fully integrated solution developed in partnership with Schréder.  Our direction of travel will lead us to more miniaturisation to enable further smart city and Industry 4.0.  Keep posted!</p>\n\n<p>If you have any comments or questions about this topic, don’t hesitate to get in touch with the SixSq team.</p>\n"

It therefore has stiff targets with regards to <strong>sustainable development</strong>, which are made harder to achieve because of significant population growth in the region. This makes the success of their projects related to energy efficiency, mobility issues and traffic management even more critical. One of its key projects is <strong>Smart Monthey</strong> which has put in place an adaptive lighting system. With approximately 2,050 luminaires installed on the territory of Monthey, innovative solutions like this are fundamental to the achievement of targets for energy savings and cost reduction.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Background</strong></p>\n\n<p>Between 2015 and 2017, mercury vapour luminaires in Monthey were replaced by LEDs and equipped with a remote management system based on <a href=\"https://www.schreder.com/en/product-technical-control-system/owlet-iot\">Owlet</a>, a solution for optimising energy consumption developed by <a href=\"https://ch.schreder.com/fr\">Schréder Swiss SA</a>. Smart lighting is made possible through the use of sensors detecting presence of traffic on the roads. This provides the right light at the right time. The luminaires can be further leveraged by the installation of sensors to carry out tasks such as counting vehicles and measuring noise pollution, etc. Anonymised data derived from these sensors can be used to inform the city’s decision making on mobility and other issues.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Smart Solution</strong></p>\n\n<p>Within the framework of the <a href=\"https://www.cityzen.ch/\">CityZen</a> association, partners Schréder Swiss and SixSq were chosen to deploy the VolumLight® solution for Smart Monthey. VolumLight® allows the control of lighting according to the volume of traffic in real time. In addition to providing optimal lighting and safety conditions, VolumLight produces valuable traffic data. This is made possible by SixSq’s <a href=\"/casestudies/overview\">Nuvla</a> solution, an open-source <a href=\"/blog/discover/2019/11/08/what-is-edge-computing\">edge computing</a> platform for scalable smart city solutions.</p>\n\n<p>Pre-processed and anonymised on the edge, the data is analysed, then represented and communicated to the various stakeholders (decision makers, associations, citizens …) via a series of interactive maps and dashboards within ArcGIS Online, the geospatial platform developed by <a href=\"https://www.esri.com/en-us/home\">Esri</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Energy savings of <strong>over 30%</strong> are expected by the end of the project.</p>\n\n<p><strong>About Schréder</strong></p>\n\n<p>Schréder is a worldwide leader in intelligent outdoor lighting solutions. The company, founded in 1907, is present in over 70 countries spanning 5 continents. Our tradition of engineering means we have been at the forefront of innovation throughout our history. The latest wave of urbanism means city centres are becoming more vital than ever: connectivity is crucial. Experts in lightability™, we propose lighting infrastructure that will play a pivotal role in building Smart Cities and future communication networks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>About CityZen</strong></p>\n\n<p>The CityZen initiative brings together Swiss companies with expertise in the field of Smart Cities and acts as a centre of competence for cities and communes which need advice on the concept, integration and realisation of Smart City projects.

        "content": "<p><a href=\"https://www.schreder.com/en\">Schréder Swiss</a>, one of Europe’s leading suppliers of street lighting equipment, in partnership with <a href=\"https://www.ekz.ch/de/ueber-ekz.html\">EKZ</a> (Elektrizitätswerke des Kantons Zürich), has been presented with the <a href=\"https://www.bfe.admin.ch/bfe/en/home/swiss-federal-office-of-energy/watt-d-or/winners-of-the-watt-dor-awards/winners-of-the-2018-watt-d-or-awards.html\">Watt d’Or 2018</a> award for the Energy Technologies Category. The prize is awarded by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy to innovative Swiss companies and organisations which have developed practical, sustainable energy solutions.</p>\n\n<p>The new light units designed by the Canton of Zurich (EKZ) and Schréder Swiss give real meaning to the term “Intelligent Lighting”. They make it possible to adapt light intensity gradually and continuously, according to the volume of traffic. This not only improves energy efficiency while reducing light pollution, but also provides benefits to residents and nocturnal creatures. Depending on the situation, this intelligent lighting system delivers up to <strong>70% energy savings</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Leveraging the latest technologies</strong></p>\n\n<p>Intelligent light systems with motion detectors have been around for a few years now. In busy streets, they have the disadvantage of turning on and off very often and quickly, which is disturbing for passers by. A new technical standard for street lighting now reduces luminosity according to traffic flows. EKZ, the Canton of Zurich’s electricity company, and Schréder Swiss came up with the idea of ​​automatically regulating the light to continuously and progressively adapt it to traffic, which is now possible thanks to the latest technologies in sensors, LEDs and communication protocols.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The test case</strong></p>\n\n<p>In Urdorf in the canton of Zurich, a street light on a busy one-kilometer stretch of road that crosses the city was equipped with an optical sensor. This observes the volume of traffic and transmits the data to a centralised control unit, which in turn sends back the signal to 27 individually-controllable luminaires. The light is thus continuously and almost imperceptibly modified. Depending on the traffic flow, light intensity varies between 40% and 100%. Pedestrian crossings are always fully lit for safety reasons. This one-year pilot project in Urdorf was a great success. The lighting worked at full speed for only one hour in the morning and three hours in the evening and could be lowered by one or more levels of intensity the rest of the time. Energy savings for the city represent nearly 30%. Depending on the situation, the savings potential can even reach 70%.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s next?</strong></p>\n\n<p>After only 6 months, the results of the pilot project in Urdorf were so promising that Schréder Swiss started to develop a solution for the market. In partnership with SixSq, the Volumlight™ solution was developed and put into service at the end of 2017. The first three installations were deployed with customers in the canton of Basel.</p>\n\n<p>Volumlight™ uses advanced technologies such as <a href=\"/blog/discover/2019/11/08/what-is-edge-computing\">edge computing</a> and Private Cloud and is future-oriented, with integration for Smart Cities already planned. With its open architecture, the system is designed to share data and functionality with other systems.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Schréder Swiss</strong></p>\n\n<p>Schréder provides high quality lighting products and is one of Europe’s leading suppliers of street lighting and exterior decorative lighting equipment. Technical quality and aesthetic design are at the heart of the company’s philosophy. Coupled with its customer-focused work ethic, this has led Schréder to develop the most cost effective, energy efficient exterior lighting innovations on the market today.</p>\n"

This EULA was created by <a href=\"https://www.eulatemplate.com\">EULA Template</a> for Vendors choosing to distribute their apps on Nuvla using this License. For this License agreement to apply, it must be referenced in the app definition in Nuvla.</p>\n\n<p>This EULA agreement governs your acquisition and use of the app software (“Software”) indirectly through Nuvla, authorized as reseller or distributor (a “Reseller”). This Privacy Policy was created by this <a href=\"https://www.generateprivacypolicy.com\">Privacy Policy Generator</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Please read this EULA agreement carefully before completing the deployment and installation process and using the app software. It provides a license to use the app software and contains warranty information and liability disclaimers.</p>\n\n<p>If you register for a free trial of the app software, this EULA agreement will also govern that trial. By clicking “accept” during the Nuvla launch process, or installing and/or using the app software, you are confirming your acceptance of the Software and agreeing to become bound by the terms of this EULA agreement.</p>\n\n<p>The free trial of Nuvla does not extend to paying apps, you can therefore be invoiced for deploying paying apps during the free trial.</p>\n\n<p>If you are entering into this EULA agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity and its affiliates to these terms and conditions. If you do not have such authority or if you do not agree with the terms and conditions of this EULA agreement, do not install or use the Software, and you must not accept this EULA agreement.</p>\n\n<p>This EULA agreement shall apply only to the Software supplied by the Vendor herewith regardless of whether other software is referred to or described herein. The terms also apply to any Vendor updates, supplements, Internet-based services, and support services for the Software, unless other terms accompany those items on delivery. If so, those terms apply.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"license-grant\">License Grant</h2>\n\n<p>The Vendor hereby grants you a personal, non-transferable, non-exclusive licence to use the app software on your devices in accordance with the terms of this EULA agreement.</p>\n\n<p>You are permitted to deploy the app software (for example on an edge device, IoT device, server, PC, or cloud infrastructure) under your control. You are responsible for ensuring your device meets the minimum requirements of the app software.</p>\n\n<p>You are not permitted to:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Edit, alter, modify, adapt, translate or otherwise change the whole or any part of the Software nor permit the whole or any part of the Software to be combined with or become incorporated in any other software, nor decompile, disassemble or reverse engineer the Software or attempt to do any such things.</li>\n  <li>Circumvent the Nuvla platform to reproduce, copy, distribute, resell or otherwise the Software for any reason.</li>\n  <li>Use the Software in any way which breaches any applicable local, national or international law.</li>\n  <li>Use the Software for any purpose that the Vendor considers is a breach of this EULA agreement.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2 id=\"limitation-of-liability\">Limitation of liability</h2>\n\n<p>The software is provided “as is”, without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement. in no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"intellectual-property-and-ownership\">Intellectual Property and Ownership</h2>\n\n<p>The Vendor shall at all times retain ownership of the Software as originally downloaded by you and all subsequent downloads of the Software by you. The Software (and the copyright, and other intellectual property rights of whatever nature in the Software, including any modifications made thereto) are and shall remain the property of the Vendor.</p>\n\n<p>The Vendor reserves the right to grant licences to use the Software to third parties.</p>\n\n<p>While the Nuvla platform operator takes mesures to protect the intellectual property of the Vendor, it is ultimately the responsibility of the Vendor to protect its Software. For example, Nuvla’s best practices include the Vendor using a private Docker registry to store its Docker images. However, this is not a fail safe approach, since customers could get access to the Docker registry access key from their edge device to get access to the registry.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"termination\">Termination</h2>\n\n<p>This EULA agreement is effective from the date you first use the Software and shall continue until terminated. You may terminate it at any time upon written notice to the Vendor.</p>\n\n<p>It will also terminate immediately if you fail to comply with any term of this EULA agreement. Upon such termination, the licenses granted by this EULA agreement will immediately terminate and you agree to stop all access and use of the Software. The provisions that by their nature continue and survive will survive any termination of this EULA agreement.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"governing-law\">Governing Law</h2>\n\n<p>This EULA agreement, and any dispute arising out of or in connection with this EULA agreement, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Switzerland.</p>\n"

Users of the Platform acknowledge that they have read these ToS and expressly accept them, without reservation and/or modification of any kind whatsoever.</p>\n\n<p>This acceptance is materialised by a checkbox on the registration form when creating an Account, or the confirmation of acceptance of an invitation to create an Account, on the Platform.</p>\n\n<p>Any use of the Platform in violation of these ToS is subject to civil and criminal penalties.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5.\tModification of the General Terms of Use</strong></p>\n\n<p>SixSq reserves the right to modify, at any time and without prior notice, all or part of these ToS. Any modification of these ToS will be published on the Website.</p>\n\n<p>Modifications to these ToS are binding on users of the Platform from the time they are posted on the Website.

By accessing, using or registering on the Platform, you represent and warrant that you are 18 years of age or older.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6.2.\tOpening the Account</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Platform allows Users to deploy, manage and update cloud and edge Applications, as well as to deploy edge equipment. The Platform also allows edge and cloud Applications to be sold and purchased on a subscription basis. Finally, the Platform offers a range of tools to secure the use of the Platform.</p>\n\n<p>To create an Account, you must fill out the activation form available on the Platform, and choose your identifiers by entering a valid user email. Any incomplete or erroneous registration request will not be validated.</p>\n\n<p>To register on the Platform, you must have read and accepted these ToS.</p>\n\n<p>When creating his/her Account, regardless of the method chosen to do so, the User guarantees to provide accurate, up-to-date and complete information during the registration process and undertakes to update said information in order to preserve its accuracy, relevance and completeness at all times.</p>\n\n<p>The User undertakes, where applicable, to keep the password chosen when creating his Account secret and not to communicate it to anyone. In the event of loss or disclosure of the password, the User undertakes to inform SixSq immediately. The User is solely responsible for the use made of his/her Account by a third party, as long as he/she has not expressly notified SixSq of the loss, fraudulent use by a third party or disclosure of his/her password to a third party.</p>\n\n<p>The User undertakes not to create or use, under his/her own identity or that of a third party, any Accounts other than the one he/she initially created.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6.3.\tAccount suspension and termination</strong></p>\n\n<p>SixSq reserves the right to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>verify the information provided by any means,</li>\n  <li>suspend or terminate an Account and access to the Platform if the User does not comply with these ToS, or if any information provided during the registration process, or thereafter, proves to be inaccurate, fraudulent, obsolete or incomplete, or otherwise violates these ToS or the rights of third parties.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You may terminate your Account at any time without additional charge and without cause. To do so, simply notify SixSq’s support department by email at <a href=\"mailto:support@sixsq.com\">support@sixsq.com</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>7.\tUse of the Platform</strong></p>\n\n<p>Users must have a valid and active account. The Platform allows Vendors to offer edge and cloud Applications. Purchasers, also Users, can purchase edge and cloud Applications by deploying these Applications on their edge and/or cloud infrastructures. A Purchaser can create a Group, which allows the sharing of different resources with other Users. The Purchaser is then responsible for the purchases made by Users in the Group, when acting as members of the Group. Users can be both Vendors and Purchasers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>8.\tFinancial Conditions</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>8.1. Consumption and Billing Follow-up</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Platform regularly measures the consumption of each Purchaser and calculates the corresponding price. The calculation is normally carried out daily and the invoices are issued monthly. The invoice is then sent to the Purchaser. Once the payment is received, the Payment Service distributes the corresponding remuneration to the Vendor, less a commission for the Platform. This commission is normally 20%, which includes the commission for the Payment Service.</p>\n\n<p><strong>8.2. Invoices and Payments</strong></p>\n\n<p>Purchasers receive their invoices by email and can consult them on the Platform. Invoices must be paid on time, normally within 14 days.</p>\n\n<p>Pay-as-you-go invoices are produced and sent on a monthly basis. Subscription invoices are produced and sent at the start of the period (normally yearly). For example, a edge management subscription (e.g. Moon or Solar System plans) will be invoiced at purchase time. Such a plan grants Purchasers access to discounted edge device management services, which will be metered and invoiced monthly, in arrears.</p>\n\n<p><strong>8.3. Unpaid Invoices</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the event that an invoice is unpaid, the Platform may block the User’s Account or limit the available functionality of the Platform.</p>\n\n<p><strong>8.4. Financial conditions for Vendors</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Vendor must provide the necessary information to be able to receive payments from the Platform’s Payment Service. The Vendor shall define the subscription amount for each Application that it offers on the Platform. The Vendor cannot sell to Purchasers Applications outside the Platform.</p>\n\n<p><strong>8.5. Financial conditions for the Platform</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Platform can offer paid services, such as subscriptions for edge device management. Prices for these services are available on the Website and the Platform.</p>\n\n<p><strong>9.\tPayment Service</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Platform, operated by SixSq, uses and integrates Stripe online payment services, including the Stripe Connect service. The Stripe ToS apply to Users of the Platform (<a href=\"https://stripe.com/en-ch/ssa\">https://stripe.com/en-ch/ssa</a>). Vendors must create a Stripe account, which is integrated when creating a Vendor profile. Users and Purchasers must register on the Platform a payment method supported by Stripe (e.g. credit card, bank account with SEPA).</p>\n\n<p><strong>10.\tCoupons</strong></p>\n\n<p>SixSq may, from time to time, offer Coupons to Vendors. These Coupons allow Vendors to offer Purchasers free discounts on their invoices for marketing and promotional purposes. These Coupons are generally single-use, time-limited and only associated with a single Application. It is the Vendor’s responsibility to notify SixSq of any lost Coupons as soon as possible. These Coupons reduce a Purchaser’s invoice either by a nominal value (the invoice cannot be negative following the Application of a Coupon) or by a percentage. The Coupon must be applied by the User when deploying an Application corresponding to the Coupon using the Platform.</p>\n\n<p><strong>12.\tCancellation Policy</strong></p>\n\n<p>The User may terminate his/her account at any time by sending an email to <a href=\"mailto:support@sixsq.com\">support@sixsq.com</a>. In this case, the Platform will issue a closing invoice that the User must pay within the time limit. Any resources associated with the User’s Account will be destroyed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>13.\tPersonal Data</strong></p>\n\n<p>As part of your use of the Platform, we may collect and process some of your personal data in order to enable SixSq to ensure the use of the Platform by Users.</p>\n\n<p>With regard to the personal data submitted by Users to SixSq, which are recorded and processed, SixSq undertakes to comply with the Regulation 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (“GDPR”) including any amendment thereof and the relevant Swiss legislation on data protection, and as further described in SixSq’s privacy policy available on SixSq’s website. <a href=\"https://sixsq.com/terms/aai-privacy\">https://sixsq.com/terms/aai-privacy</a></p>\n\n<p>SixSq shall take appropriate technical and organisational measures against unauthorised or unlawful processing of Users’s data or its accidental loss, destruction or damage.

The project kicked off on 1 January 2017 and ran until 31 December 2019. The mobile Fog to Cloud project addressed the need for an open and coordinated management of fog and cloud computing systems.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is Fog computing?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Fog computing, also known as fog networking or fogging, is a decentralised computing infrastructure in which data, compute, storage and applications are distributed in the most logical, efficient place between the data source and the cloud. Fog computing extends cloud computing and services to the edge of the network, bringing the advantages and power of the cloud closer to where data is created and acted upon.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why is it important?</strong></p>\n\n<p>With the number of devices exponentially growing globally, new cloud and fog models are expected to emerge, paving the way for collaborative, mobile, volatile and dynamic compute, storage and network infrastructures. When put together, cloud and fog computing create a new stack of resources, which we refer to as Fog-to-Cloud (F2C), creating the need for a new, open and coordinated management ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How was the project funded?</strong></p>\n\n<p>SixSq’s participation was supported by the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation <a href=\"https://www.sbfi.admin.ch/sbfi/en/home.html\">SERI</a> under contract number 16.0202.
