<h1 id="nuvla-terms-and-conditions">Nuvla Terms and Conditions</h1>

<p>Thanks for using Nuvla! These general terms and conditions (Terms) cover your use and access to our website, content and Services (as defined below). Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use your information. Please read both documents carefully and make sure you understand them. If you do not understand or do not accept any part of these Terms or our Privacy Policy, you must not use the Services or access the Website.</p>

<h2 id="1-who-we-are">1.	Who we are</h2>
<p>SixSq SA (“SixSq”, “we” or “us”) is a company registered in Switzerland, with company registration number CHE-113.788.438 and registered offices at SixSq Route de Meyrin, 267 1217, Meyrin Geneva, Switzerland. Please contact us at info@sixsq.com or support@sixsq.com.</p>

<h2 id="2-our-services">2.	Our Services</h2>

<p><strong>2.1.	Platform.</strong> SixSq designed Nuvla, an online platform accessible via https://nuvla.io/ui that brings together customers (Customers) and sellers (Vendors) for containerised edge applications and device management, as well as offers APIs and user interface channels (the “Platform”).</p>

<p><strong>2.2.	Users.</strong> Customers and Vendors are collectively referred to as “Users”. The Platform operates as a business-to-business (B2B) digital marketplace where Vendors offer their containerised edge applications to Customers. In addition, SixSq supports Users with tools to develop, test, access, secure the use of the Platform and launch of Vendor’s applications.</p>

<p><strong>2.3.	Services.</strong> SixSq enables Users to deploy, manage and update cloud and edge applications, as well as to deploy edge equipment and manage edge devices. The Platform also allows Vendors to offer paid and free applications to Customers (collectively referred to as “Services”).</p>

<p><strong>2.4.	Purpose of these Terms.</strong> These Terms define the terms and conditions of use of the Platform and the Services, and are accessible at any time on the website https://sixsq.com/ (Website).</p>

<p><strong>2.5.	Independence of the parties.</strong> SixSq acts as a platform operator and does not intervene in the contractual relationship between Customers and Vendors, including agreements signed by such parties (Vendor Terms). Users thus act on their behalf so that SixSq cannot be considered an agent concerning them. These Terms do not constitute an association, a joint venture, a franchise, a partnership, a subordinate relationship or a mandate given by SixSq.</p>

<p><strong>2.6.	Additional terms.</strong> These Terms only govern Users’ access and use of the Website, the Platform and, where applicable, the Services. Any other terms of use, licences or other relevant agreements that may apply to the Vendor’s products or services will be governed by Vendor Terms, or other appropriate documents. SixSq is not a party to and is not bound by any Vendor Terms.</p>

<h2 id="3-accessing-the-services">3.	Accessing the Services</h2>

<p><strong>3.1.	Nuvla account.</strong> Users need to create a Nuvla account on the Platform to view, purchase, access, use, deploy and install Services.</p>

<p><strong>3.2.	Nuvla account creation.</strong> To create an account, Users must complete the sign-up activation form on the Website and accept these Terms. Any incomplete or inaccurate registration requests will not be validated. Account creation is free of charge. Once Users have created an account, they can select the Services or resources they want to purchase (refer to the Payment section of these Terms for more information).</p>

<p><strong>3.3.	Eligibility.</strong> The Platform operates as a B2B marketplace. Please do not use the Platform if you are not operating as a business. By accessing, using or registering on the Platform on behalf of a business or organisation, Users represent and warrant that they are doing so for a purpose related to its commercial activity, that they have the required authorisation from that business or organisation to do so, and that they are binding the business or organisation to these Terms. We have the right to verify that the information provided by the User is correct and valid. Users are responsible for keeping their business information and details accurate and up to date. Users who don’t provide accurate, complete or valid information may have their account suspended or cancelled by SixSq.</p>

<p><strong>3.4.	Account information.</strong> Users are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their account information, including passwords, and for any account activity that occurs due to their failure to keep such information secure and confidential. Users agree to immediately notify SixSq of any unauthorised use of their account, password, or any other security breach. Users may be held liable for losses incurred by SixSq or any other User or visitor to the Website or Platform due to the use of the information such as username, password or account by another person as a result of the User’s failure to keep account information confidential.</p>

<p><strong>3.5.	Restrictions.</strong> SixSq reserves all rights to the Services not expressly granted by SixSq. When using the Services and accessing the Platform, Users may not:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; list-style-color: #black; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
  <li>modify, copy, distribute, transmit, display, perform, reproduce, publish, license, create derivative works from, transfer, rent or sell any data or information without SixSq’s permission;</li>
  <li>avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate, impair, descramble, or otherwise circumvent any technological measure implemented by SixSq in or relating to the Platform or the Services, including those related to SixSq’s payment system, or act in such a way which poses a security vulnerability to the Platform, the Services or Users;</li>
  <li>disassemble, decompile, decrypt, hack, emulate, exploit, or reverse engineer any aspect of the Platform or the Services, except and only to the extent that applicable copyright law expressly permits doing so;</li>
  <li>engage in fraud or misuse of the Platform or Services, or any conduct that is harmful or harassing to anybody;</li>
  <li>post, upload, publish, submit, or transmit any content or information that is illegal, harmful or a violation of any federal, state, or local law or regulation, or the rights of any other person or entity;</li>
  <li>enable access to the Platform or the Services by unauthorised third-party applications or otherwise in a manner intended to avoid incurring fees, or which constitutes any excessive or abusive usage; and</li>
  <li>transfer or collect any fees or charges for the Services outside the Platform to avoid paying fees, taxes, or for any other reason, except if expressly authorised by SixSq.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>3.6.	Housekeeping.</strong> SixSq reserves the right to perform, from time to time, housekeeping tasks on disused resources owned by Users to ensure the best performance of the Platform. These housekeeping tasks will not affect the normal use of the Platform by its Users.</p>

<p><strong>3.7.	Geographic Restrictions.</strong> Certain Services may only be available in some countries. Users agree that they will not provide any false, inaccurate or misleading information to misrepresent their country of residence and will not attempt to circumvent any restrictions on access to or availability of the Services or content available on our Platform.</p>

<h2 id="4-payment-purchasing-and-billing">4.	Payment, purchasing and billing</h2>

<p><strong>4.1. Pricing.</strong> We offer both free and paid Services. By ordering paid Services, Users agree to pay the fees within the terms displayed to them when they order that particular Service. The prices, features, capacity, limits and other functionalities of the Services depend on the type of Services ordered.</p>

<p><strong>4.2. Free trials.</strong> SixSq may offer Users free trials from time to time to use the Platform (e.g., a 14-day free trial). Users may benefit from limited SixSq support services and discounts on edge costs on the Platform during such free trial periods. The free trial does not extend to paid Vendor’s applications, so Users can be charged for deploying any paid Vendor’s applications or other paid Services during the free trial. Users will continue to be able to use the feel trial for additional Services and products that are not paid. More information on the free trial, periods, and consumption is available on each User’s profile page. Users may also contact support@sixsq.com if they have any questions.</p>

<p><strong>4.3. Payment for Vendor’s applications.</strong> Vendors offer both free and paid applications on the Platform. Each Vendor’s pricing information can be viewed on the Platform (on the relevant application’s page). Please review all the information carefully before launching any application. Customers can purchase Vendors’ paid applications using selected payment methods (e.g., credit cards or a bank account with SEPA) or receive invoices from SixSq.</p>

<p><strong>4.4. Payment for edge device management.</strong> SixSq offers Users pay-as-you-go options and optionally yearly subscription plans for edge device management (note: an edge device is a computer running the NuvlaEdge software).</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
  <li><strong>Pay-as-you-go:</strong> SixSq regularly measures each Customer’s consumption and the number of devices on the Platform and calculates the corresponding price. SixSq then invoices Customers monthly. Users only pay for what they use. More information about this option can be found on our Pricing Page.</li>
  <li><strong>Yearly subscription plans:</strong> SixSq also offers three yearly subscription levels: (a) Airplane; (b) Rocket; and (c) Starship, which can reduce your pay-as-you-go monthly fee. Users can view the details of the subscription plans on our Pricing Page.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>4.5. Third-party payment processors.</strong> For certain Services, payment may be processed and handled through third-party payment processors. By choosing to pay through such third-party payment processors, you agree to be bound by and accept the terms and conditions of those processors. Any payments processed through third-party payment processors are subject not only to these Terms, where applicable, but also the terms and conditions of the applicable third party payment processor pursuant to your agreement with them.</p>

<p><strong>4.6. Invoices.</strong> Customers receive invoices by email and can consult them on the Platform for the ordered services. All invoices must be paid on time. Pay-as-you-go invoices are sent every month, and subscription invoices are sent at the start of the subscription period (usually yearly).</p>

<p><strong>4.7. Unpaid invoices.</strong> If an invoice is unpaid, SixSq may block the Customer’s account or limit the available functionality of the Platform.</p>

<p><strong>4.8. Commission.</strong> SixSq may charge a commission fee for its services on the Platform, which shall be a percentage of the total price due for a specific application purchased on the Platform. Upon relevant payment through the Platform by a Customer, SixSq will deduct the commission fee from such amount and transfer the remaining amount to the Vendor. Any applicable commission fees will be disclosed to you via the Platform.</p>

<p><strong>4.9. Discounts.</strong> SixSq may, from time to time, offer discounts in the form of coupons or credits on Services. Additional terms and conditions, including eligibility criteria, may apply, and any additional terms will be made available to Users before purchase. Such discounts are generally single-use, time-limited and only associated with a single Service. It is the Vendor’s responsibility to notify SixSq of any lost coupons as soon as possible. These coupons reduce a Customer’s invoice by either a nominal value or a percentage.</p>

<p><strong>4.10. Hardware.</strong> We do not provide hardware and no hardware cost is included in our pricing.</p>

<p><strong>4.11. Taxes.</strong> If SixSq is required to collect or pay any taxes in connection with User’s purchase, such taxes will be charged to the User at the time of each transaction.</p>

<p><strong>4.12. Payment service providers.</strong> The Platform may use and integrate with third-party online payment services. Vendors may be required to set up an account with such online third-party payment service to enable receipt of payment. Users must register on the Platform a payment method supported by such payment providers (e.g. credit card, a bank account with SEPA). We will display the available online payment service to User’s profile page on the Platform.</p>

<p><strong>4.13.	Price changes.</strong> We reserve the right to change price, availability information and other conditions without notice.</p>

<h2 id="5-account-suspension-and-termination">5.	Account suspension and termination</h2>

<p><strong>5.1. Terminations by Users.</strong> Users may stop using the Service and terminate their account on the Platform at any time. To do so, they must notify SixSq at support@sixsq.com. However, such action will not affect the User’s obligation to pay any outstanding fees.</p>

<p><strong>5.2. Termination and suspensions by SixSq.</strong> SixSq reserves the right to restrict, suspend or terminate Users’ account or access to all or part of the Services, Platform or Website if</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
  <li>Users are in material or repeated breach of these Terms;</li>
  <li>we are forced to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order;</li>
  <li>we reasonably believe there has been conduct that creates (or may create) liability or harm to any other User, any third party or SixSq; or</li>
  <li>if any information provided for the User proves to be inaccurate, fraudulent, or incomplete, or otherwise violates these Terms or the rights of third parties.</li>
</ol>

<p>Please note that suspension or cancellation of access could result in a loss of User data.</p>

<p><strong>5.3. Notice for termination or suspension by SixSq.</strong> We will provide Users with a statement setting out the reasons for termination or suspension unless we reasonably believe that doing so would: (a) violate the law or the direction of a legal authority or court order; (b) compromise a legal investigation or proceeding; (c) threaten the integrity, operation or security of the Service; or (d) cause harm to any User, third party or SixSq. In the case of overall termination, such a statement of reasons will be provided to the User at least 30 days in advance. If the User believes the termination or suspension has been made in error, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@sixsq.com">support@sixsq.com</a>.</p>
