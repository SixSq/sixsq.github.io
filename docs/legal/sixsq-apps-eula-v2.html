If you do not accept the terms of this EULA, then you must not use or access the Application.

<h2 id="7-disclaimers-and-limitation-of-liability">7.	Disclaimers and Limitation of liability</h2>

<p><strong>7.1</strong>	Except as otherwise stated in this EULA, the Application and, if applicable, the Documentation and support are provided on an “as-is” basis by SixSq. To the fullest extent permitted by law, SixSq and its affiliates make no representations or warranties concerning the Application and Documentation and or parts thereof, whether express, implied, or statutory, including but not limited to implied warranties of satisfactory quality and fitness for a particular purpose.</p>

<p><strong>7.2</strong>	Specifically, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, SixSq and its affiliates make no representation or warranty that: (i) the Application has been developed to meet the Customer’s requirements. It is the Customer’s responsibility to ensure that the functions of the Application as described in SixSq’s specification or Documentation meet their requirements and needs; (ii) the use of the Application and Documentation and or parts thereof will be uninterrupted or error-free; or (iii) any use of the Application and Documentation and or parts thereof are free from infringement of any third party’s IPR. The Customer is responsible for making such determination concerning acquiring licenses and other IPRs of third parties. Consequently, SixSq and its affiliates disclaim any liability in case any use by the Customer or any other party infringes any third party’s IPR. Furthermore, SixSq and its affiliates disclaim any warranty and liability whatsoever for any development created by or for the Customer or their organisation.</p>

<p><strong>7.3</strong>	SixSq shall not be liable to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, whether in tort (including for negligence or breach of statutory duty), contract, misrepresentation, restitution or otherwise, for any loss of profits, sales, revenues or savings, loss of business, depletion of goodwill and similar losses or loss or corruption of data or information, or pure economic loss, or any special, indirect or consequential loss, costs, damages, charges or expenses however arising or otherwise resulting from your use of the Application or your inability to use the Application. SixSq shall not be liable for any of the losses, even if you have informed SixSq of the possibility of such losses.</p>

<p><strong>7.4</strong>	In no event shall SixSq’s liability exceed the amount SixSq received for the Application from you in the calendar year the claim is made. In the event of any liability to you, you agree that in full satisfaction of such liability, SixSq may at its discretion: (i) refund the price you paid to SixSq for the Application: (ii) repair the Application; or (iii) replace the Application as they case may be. In all cases SixSq will not be liable for any loss or damage that was not reasonably foreseeable.</p>

<p><strong>7.5</strong>	Nothing in this EULA shall limit SixSq’s liability for losses which may not be lawfully limited or excluded by applicable law.</p>

<p><strong>7.6</strong>	In no event shall SixSq be liable if any failure of/or defect in the Application is the result of misuse or abuse, or otherwise if the Application has not been used in accordance with the specification or Documentation for the Application.</p>
