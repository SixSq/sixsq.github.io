[History](https://github.com/SixSq/nuvla-io.github.com/commits/main/_terms/apps-license.md)

This End-User License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement between you and SixSq SA regarding the apps you are deploying via Nuvla under this license. This EULA was created by [EULA Template](https://www.eulatemplate.com). For this License agreement to apply, it must be referenced in the app definition in Nuvla.

This EULA agreement governs your acquisition and use of the app software ("Software") indirectly through Nuvla, authorized as reseller or distributor (a "Reseller"). This Privacy Policy was created by this [Privacy Policy Generator](https://www.generateprivacypolicy.com).

Please read this EULA agreement carefully before completing the deployment and installation process and using the app software. It provides a license to use the app software and contains warranty information and liability disclaimers.

If you register for a free trial of the app software, this EULA agreement will also govern that trial. By clicking "accept" during the Nuvla launch process, or installing and/or using the app software, you are confirming your acceptance of the Software and agreeing to become bound by the terms of this EULA agreement.

The free trial of Nuvla does not extend to paying apps, you can therefore be invoiced for deploying paying apps during the free trial.

If you do not have such authority or if you do not agree with the terms and conditions of this EULA agreement, do not install or use the Software, and you must not accept this EULA agreement.

This EULA agreement shall apply only to the Software supplied by SixSq herewith regardless of whether other software is referred to or described herein.

If so, those terms apply.
