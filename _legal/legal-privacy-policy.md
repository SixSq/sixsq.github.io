- email address

- organisation

and any other information that you might willingly share when you authenticate via a social media provider or identity provider.

We may also ask you to provide further information in order to invoice you electronically for our services. SixSq uses the [Stripe](https://stripe.com) payment service for this. This data is not held by SixSq, but transferred to Stripe. This information can include:

- email
- name
- credit card details

Please refer to [Stripe's privacy policies](https://stripe.com/en-ch/privacy) for additional information.

Our services may also use the [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com) online service to provide customer support and in-app chat and communication. Intercom receives the following information from us:

- email
- status of trial
- key events (e.g. first deployment, first application creation, first NuvlaEdge registration)
- approximate location

Please refer to [Intercom's privacy policies](https://www.intercom.com/legal/privacy) for additional information.

SixSq uses Stripe and Intercom to provide a better service to its users. None of the above information shall be used for purposes beyond the service provided to SixSq by these third party vendors. 

The processing of personal data is [governed by the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32016R0679) (GDPR).


3\. How will we use your personal data?
---  

The personal data we collect from you is mostly used to identify you as a user/customer of our products and services (authentication and authorisation). Your personal data (for example email) might also be used to communicate important matters related to your usage and general status (like billing, service maintenances, etc.) of the products and services you've registered for.

Your personal data might also be used to link your user account with third party service providers, such as Docker registries.

Any other personal data processing purposes other than the ones described in this notice will be preceded by a new data processing notice, asking for your consent.

3.1. Access to personal data

SixSq only reserves the rights to manage your personal data, it being entirely owned by you.

If at any time you wish to be provided with a copy of all the information we have about you, you have the right to request it using the contact information provided in section 1.

3.2. Data retention

Personal data can be completely erased on request. Other retention policies include removing personal data of inactive users after a period of 24 months.

3.3. Data integrity

As a data controller, SixSq complies with GDPR when it comes to:
 - protecting personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorised access;
 - storing, managing and deleting personal data;
 - maintaining full transparency between the data we hold and the user;
 - keeping personal data up to date.

Data integrity is enforced by the implementation of ISO27001 controls.

3.4. Sharing

Personal data is not transferred to any 3rd parties unless:

 - consent has been given by the user, or
 - mandated by the Service Provider for enabling access to its service on its behalf;
 - the 3rd party has undertaken similar duties considered sufficient under the data protection law applicable to the Service Provider.

3.5. Lawfulness of processing (according to [Article 6 of the GDPR](https://www.privacy-regulation.eu/en/article-6-lawfulness-of-processing-GDPR.htm))

Lawful processing of your personal data is ensured by applying the following:

 - _"the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes"_;

**No special categories of personal data ([Article 9 of the GDPR](https://www.privacy-regulation.eu/en/article-9-processing-of-special-categories-of-personal-data-GDPR.htm)) are processed by SixSq**.

Where do we keep your personal data?

All personal data is kept within EU and Swiss data centres and might be moved between data centres residing in other countries also within the EU and Switzerland.
