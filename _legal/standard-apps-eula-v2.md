[History](https://github.com/SixSq/sixsq.github.io/commits/main/_legal/standard-apps-eula-v2.md)

##### Note: SixSq updated the Standard End-User License Agreement (EULA) on 27 April 2023. This new EULA applies to all apps for App Vendors create with this EULA (instead of using there own) from this date.  App Vendors with existing apps using this standard EULA, and customers running apps with this standard EULA have two weeks to review the new EULA before it automatically applies. Therefore, from the 11 May 2023, all apps using this standard EULA will be governed by this updated agreement. In the meantime, existing app vendors and users are invited to carefully review the agreement, if you are using an app published under this EULA. If you don't want to be bound by this new agreement, you must delete the apps using it and terminate all deployments of these apps.  We are of course available if you have any questions regarding this new standard EULA.

The previous generic EULA is available [here](/legal/generic-apps-license-v1).

## IMPORTANT NOTICE

Please carefully read the following terms and conditions of this Standard End-User License Agreement (EULA) before using, downloading and installing any application (Application) and user guides, and online or electronic materials (Documentation) on the Nuvla website [https://nuvla.io](https://nuvla.io), a business-to-business (B2B) digital platform for containerised applications operated by SixSq SA (Platform). This EULA is a legal agreement between the person or entity described as the provider of the application on the Platform (Vendor) and the person or entity using, installing, accessing and/or purchasing the Application (Customer or you). 

By clicking "accept" during the Nuvla Platform launch process, or by installing and/or using the Application, you are agreeing to be bound by this EULA from the date of such action (Effective Date). If you register for a free trial of the Platform, this EULA will also govern that trial. If you do not accept this EULA, then you must not use the Application.

Customer will immediately notify Vendor if it believes there has been unauthorised access to or use of such Customer's account or account information.

**1.2	Vendor Support.** Vendors are solely responsible for any support required by the Customer in relation to the Applications, and for any information provided to their Customers. All support requests should be made directly to the Vendor by the Customer. SixSq may provide Vendors with support description and examples, but SixSq does not provide any support for the Applications provided by Vendors. If the Vendor provides Application support this will be reference on the Platform and such support will be provided in accordance with Vendor’s applicable support policy and business hours. Note that not all Applications listed on the Platform include support. 

**1.3	Service Level Agreement.** If the Vendor provides a service level agreement (SLA) for the Application this will be specified on the Platform. Vendor will provide the service in accordance with its applicable SLA, and inform the Customer accordingly. Note that not all Application listed on the Platform includes a SLA.

## 2.	License

**2.1	License.** Vendor hereby grants the Customer a personal, non-transferable, non-exclusive licence to use the Application on their devices on the Platform, in accordance with this EULA. No license of the Application’s source code is given hereunder. If you breach this EULA, Vendor may immediately and without notice to you terminate this EULA and any associated licenses and your right to use the Application is terminated immediately. In such cases, the Vendor might request the Platform operator (SixSq) to terminate the Customer’s account, or limit its access to the Platform. 

**2.2	Use.** You are permitted to deploy the Application (for example on an edge device, IoT device, server, PC, or cloud infrastructure) under your control. You are responsible for ensuring your device meets the minimum requirements of the Application.

**2.3	Coupons and free trials.** You may be offered coupons, credits, free trials or free versions to enable access to the Application. However, the Vendor reserves the right at any time to cancel, modify or charge the conditions of such coupons or credits, and to cancel, modify or charge for further use of the Application under free trial or free versions options. Please note the functionality of the Application may be limited during such periods.

## 3.	Customer Obligations

**3.1	Payment.** The Customer shall pay for the Application as described on the Application page on the Platform. All payments must be made by the Customer via the Platform.

## 4.	Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)

**4.1	Ownership.** Except as expressly stated in this EULA, this EULA does not grant either Customer or Vendor any rights to each other’s content or any of the other's IPR. As between Customer and Vendor, Customer owns all IPR in the Customer data, and Vendor owns all IPR in the Application and the Documentation. 

**4.2	Vendor’s IPR.** Vendor shall at all times retain ownership of its Application as originally accessed or downloaded by you and all subsequent downloads of the Application by you.
