If you do not accept the terms of this EULA, then you must not use or access the Application. 
Please note that if you use, access, install and/or purchase an Application provided by a third-party vendor on the Platform, then you will be bound by the EULA of that relevant Application. This EULA applies exclusively to the Applications provided by SixSq.
